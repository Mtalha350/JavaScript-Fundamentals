# Working with Dates and Times in JavaScript

When building real-world applications, one type of data that comes up frequently is **dates and times**. In this video, we will learn the fundamentals of dates and times in JavaScript, which will help us implement them in our applications.

### 1. **Creating Dates**

There are four main ways to create dates in JavaScript using the `new Date()` constructor function. Let's explore each method.

#### 1.1 **Current Date and Time**

You can create a date that represents the current date and time with the following code:

```javascript
const now = new Date();
console.log(now);
```

This will log the current date and time, such as:

```
Sunday, August 2, 2020 10:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
```

#### 1.2 **Parsing a Date String**

You can also pass a date string into the `new Date()` constructor, and JavaScript will automatically parse it:

```javascript
const christmas = new Date("December 24, 2015");
console.log(christmas);
```

This will log the date for Christmas 2015:

```
Thu Dec 24 2015 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
```

**Note**: Be cautious when passing custom date strings, as parsing can be unreliable unless the string is formatted correctly.

#### 1.3 **Date with Specific Components**

Another method is to create a date by specifying the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds:

```javascript
const specificDate = new Date(2037, 10, 19, 15, 23, 5);
console.log(specificDate);
```

This will create a date for November 19, 2037, at 15:23:05.

**Important**: In JavaScript, the month is zero-based, meaning `10` represents November.

#### 1.4 **Date from Milliseconds**

You can create a date by passing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix time):

```javascript
const dateFromTimestamp = new Date(0);
console.log(dateFromTimestamp);
```

This will log:

```
Thu Jan 01 1970 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
```

You can also add milliseconds to get a date a few days later:

```javascript
const threeDaysLater = new Date(3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
console.log(threeDaysLater);
```

This will log the date three days after Unix time (January 4, 1970).

### 2. **Working with Date Methods**

JavaScript Date objects come with methods to retrieve and manipulate individual date components.

#### 2.1 **Getting Date Components**

You can get the full year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds from a date object:

```javascript
const future = new Date(2037, 10, 19, 15, 23, 5);

console.log(future.getFullYear()); // 2037
console.log(future.getMonth()); // 10 (November)
console.log(future.getDate()); // 19
console.log(future.getDay()); // 4 (Thursday)
console.log(future.getHours()); // 15
console.log(future.getMinutes()); // 23
console.log(future.getSeconds()); // 5
```

**Note**: The `getDay()` method returns the day of the week, where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and so on.

#### 2.2 **Getting a Formatted Date String**

You can get a nicely formatted string of the date using the `toISOString()` method:

```javascript
console.log(future.toISOString());
```

This will log:

```
2037-11-19T15:23:05.000Z
```

#### 2.3 **Getting the Timestamp**

You can also get the timestamp, which is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970:

```javascript
console.log(future.getTime());
```

This will log a large number representing the milliseconds since Unix time.

#### 2.4 **Getting the Current Timestamp**

To get the current timestamp without creating a new date object, you can use the `Date.now()` method:

```javascript
console.log(Date.now());
```

### 3. **Setting Date Components**

You can also modify the components of a date using `set` methods, such as `setFullYear()`, `setMonth()`, and `setDate()`:

```javascript
future.setFullYear(2040);
console.log(future);
```

This will update the year to 2040 and log the updated date.

### 4. **Conclusion**

Working with dates and times in JavaScript can be tricky, but by understanding how to create and manipulate dates using the `Date` constructor and its methods, you can effectively handle dates in your applications.
