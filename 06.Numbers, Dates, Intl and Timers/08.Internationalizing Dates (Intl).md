# Internationalization API in JavaScript

## Introduction

JavaScript has a new Internationalization API. This API allows us to easily format numbers and strings according to different languages. It is particularly useful when creating applications that support multiple languages, ensuring they are correctly localized for users worldwide. For example, dates, currencies, and other cultural representations vary across regions, and this API helps handle those differences effectively.

## Formatting Dates with the Internationalization API

Let's explore how we can format dates using the Internationalization API.

In our application, we have dates in two places: one on the login page and one in the movements section. In this example, we will focus on formatting the date that is displayed after logging in.

### Step 1: Using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`

In the past, we might have written custom code to format dates. Now, we can leverage the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` function from the Internationalization API to handle the date formatting.

Here’s the code to format the current date:

```javascript
const currentDate = new Date();
const formattedDate = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US").format(currentDate);
console.log(formattedDate); // Example: 4/24/2025
```

In the example above, the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` function is used to format the date according to the `en-US` locale, which is common in the United States (month first, day second).

### Step 2: Trying Different Locales

You can experiment with different locales to see how the date is formatted differently in various languages:

- **U.S. English (en-US)**:
  - `4/24/2025`
- **U.K. English (en-GB)**:
  - `24/04/2025`
- **Arabic for Syria (ar-SY)**:
  - `٢٤‏/٠٤‏/٢٠٢٥`

You can find different locale codes by referring to an [ISO language code table](https://www.lingos.net/iso-language-codes/).

### Step 3: Customizing Date Format

You can further customize the format by providing an options object. For instance, if you want to display the time along with the date, you can specify additional properties like `hour`, `minute`, `second`, and `weekday`.

Example:

```javascript
const options = {
  weekday: "long",
  year: "numeric",
  month: "long",
  day: "numeric",
  hour: "numeric",
  minute: "numeric",
};
const formattedDateWithTime = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", options).format(
  currentDate
);
console.log(formattedDateWithTime); // Example: Wednesday, April 24, 2025, 2:45 PM
```

### Step 4: Automatically Using the User’s Locale

Instead of hardcoding a locale, you can automatically get the user’s preferred language from the browser:

```javascript
const locale = navigator.language;
const formattedDateForUser = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale).format(
  currentDate
);
console.log(formattedDateForUser); // This will use the browser's language setting
```

### Step 5: Applying Localization in the Application

In our application, we have an `account` object for each user, which contains a `locale` property. Based on the user’s locale, we can format the dates appropriately.

Here’s how you can use the user's locale in the application:

```javascript
const locale = currentAccount.locale;
const formattedDateForAccount = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale).format(
  currentDate
);
console.log(formattedDateForAccount); // Displays the date in the account's locale format
```

### Step 6: Formatting Dates in the Movements

Similarly, you can apply the same logic to format dates in other parts of the application, like in the movements section.

```javascript
function formatMovementDate(date, locale) {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale).format(date);
}
```

### Conclusion

With the Internationalization API, we can easily format dates according to the user’s locale. This not only improves the user experience but also ensures that the application is correctly localized for a global audience.
