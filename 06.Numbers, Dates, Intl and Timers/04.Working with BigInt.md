# Introduction to BigInt in JavaScript

In 2020, JavaScript introduced a new primitive data type called `BigInt`. This type is used to represent integers larger than the `Number` type can handle.

### Why BigInt is Necessary

In JavaScript, the `Number` type represents numbers using 64 bits. However, only 53 of these bits are used for storing the actual digits of the number. The remaining bits are for the sign and the position of the decimal point. This results in a maximum safe integer that JavaScript can accurately represent:

```
2^53 - 1 = 9007199254740991
```

This is the largest integer JavaScript can represent safely, and it's called `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Numbers larger than this can lead to precision issues, as JavaScript cannot accurately represent them.

### BigInt Overview

`BigInt` is a new primitive type that allows JavaScript to handle arbitrarily large integers. With `BigInt`, you can work with numbers larger than the `Number` type can safely represent.

#### Creating BigInt

You can create a `BigInt` by appending an `n` to the end of an integer literal or by using the `BigInt()` constructor.

Example:

```javascript
const bigNumber1 = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // using the n suffix
const bigNumber2 = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890"); // using the BigInt constructor
```

#### Operations with BigInt

Most mathematical operations can be performed on `BigInt` just like with regular numbers. However, there are a few key differences:

1. **Addition**:

   ```javascript
   let bigNumber = 10000n + 20000n; // Result: 30000n
   ```

2. **Multiplication**:

   ```javascript
   let bigNumber = 100000n * 10000n; // Result: 1000000000n
   ```

3. **Cannot Mix `BigInt` with Regular Numbers**:  
   You cannot mix `BigInt` and regular numbers in operations.

   ```javascript
   let result = 10n * 10; // Error: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
   ```

   You need to explicitly convert the regular number to a `BigInt`:

   ```javascript
   let result = 10n * BigInt(10); // Result: 100n
   ```

#### Comparisons with BigInt

When comparing `BigInt` with regular numbers, you cannot use the strict equality operator (`===`), because they are of different types.

```javascript
let isEqual = 10n === 10; // Result: false
let isEqualLoose = 10n == 10; // Result: true (due to type coercion)
```

#### String Concatenation

When concatenating a `BigInt` with a string, the `BigInt` will be automatically converted to a string:

```javascript
let bigString = 10n + " is a big number"; // Result: "10 is a big number"
```

#### Division with BigInt

Dividing a `BigInt` results in truncation (no decimals):

```javascript
let result = 10n / 3n; // Result: 3n (decimal part is truncated)
```

### Limitations and Restrictions

1. **No Floating Point Support**: You cannot perform operations like square roots or other operations that result in non-integer numbers:

   ```javascript
   Math.sqrt(16n); // Error: Invalid operation
   ```

2. **Cannot Parse Strings with BigInt**: If you attempt to parse a string with `BigInt` containing non-numeric characters, it will not work as expected:
   ```javascript
   BigInt("123_456"); // Error: Invalid BigInt
   ```

### Conclusion

`BigInt` is a useful addition to JavaScript, allowing developers to work with very large integers that are beyond the limits of the traditional `Number` type. Although in most cases, you might not need to use `BigInt`, it is essential for situations that require handling of large numbers, such as database IDs or precise scientific calculations.

BigInt provides the flexibility to handle large integers without losing precision, making JavaScript a more powerful tool for working with big data.
