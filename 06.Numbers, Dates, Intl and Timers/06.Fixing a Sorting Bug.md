# Fixing Bug with Sorting Movements and Dates

## Problem

When sorting movements in the user interface, the movement values sorted correctly, but their corresponding dates did not move along with them. The dates stayed in place, which was a bug caused by sorting only the movements array while not considering the dates array.

## Solution

### Step 1: Combine Movements and Dates

To solve the issue, we need to combine the movements and dates together into a single data structure. This will allow us to sort both the movements and their corresponding dates together.

We will create an array of objects, where each object contains a movement value and its corresponding date. This ensures that when we sort by the movement value, the date stays with the correct movement.

```js
const combinedMovementsAndDates = acc.movements.map((movement, index) => ({
  movement: movement,
  date: acc.movementsDates[index],
}));
```

### Step 2: Sort the Combined Data Structure

Once we have the combined data structure, we can now sort it based on the movement value. When we sort the array of objects, both the movement value and the date will be sorted together, fixing the bug.

We apply the `sort` method on the `combinedMovementsAndDates` array.

```js
if (sort) {
  combinedMovementsAndDates.sort((a, b) => a.movement - b.movement);
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Display Function

Next, we need to modify the `displayMovements` function to handle the combined data structure. Instead of looping over the `movements` array, we will loop over the `combinedMovementsAndDates` array.

We destructure each object inside the array to get the `movement` and `date` properties.

```js
combinedMovementsAndDates.forEach(({ movement, date }) => {
  // Display the movement and date here
});
```

### Step 4: Update the Date Display

Now, instead of reading the date from the original array, we read it from the `combinedMovementsAndDates` array.

```js
const movementDate = date;
```

### Step 5: Test the Fix

After making the changes, test the sorting feature to ensure that the movement values and their corresponding dates are sorted correctly.

1. Click the sort button.
2. Verify that the movement values and dates are sorted together.

## Conclusion

By combining the movement values and dates into a single data structure, we were able to fix the bug where the dates were not moving with their corresponding movement values during sorting. This solution ensures that both values stay together when sorted.
