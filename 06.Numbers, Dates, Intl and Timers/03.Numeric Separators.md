# Numeric Separators in JavaScript

Starting from the year 2021, JavaScript introduced a feature called **Numeric Separators** to make numbers easier to read and understand, especially when dealing with large numbers.

## What is a Numeric Separator?

A numeric separator is simply an underscore (`_`) that can be placed in numbers to separate parts of large values, making it easier for both developers and other people to read the number. However, these separators have no effect on the value itself in the code.

For example, let's say we wanted to represent a really large number, like the diameter of our solar system:

```js
let diameter = 287_460_000_000;
console.log(diameter); // 287460000000
```

The number `287_460_000_000` is much easier to read and understand than writing `287460000000`.

## How It Works

Although the number is written with underscores for clarity, JavaScript actually ignores these separators when parsing the number. So, the engine sees `287460000000`, but the code is more readable for developers.

### Example 1: Large Numbers

```js
let diameter = 287_460_000_000; // Makes it easier to read
console.log(diameter); // 287460000000
```

### Example 2: Price in Cents

```js
let priceInCents = 345_99; // Makes it clear we are dealing with cents
console.log(priceInCents); // 34599
```

Here, the underscore between `345` and `99` makes it obvious that the number represents 345 dollars and 99 cents.

### Example 3: Transfer Fee

```js
let transferFee = 1_500; // $1500
console.log(transferFee); // 1500
```

You could also use underscores to differentiate between the number's parts.

## Restrictions on Where You Can Place Numeric Separators

There are a few rules regarding the placement of the underscore in a number:

- **Valid Placement**: You can place underscores between digits, but not at the beginning or the end of a number.

  ```js
  let pi = 3.141_5; // Works
  ```

- **Invalid Placement**: You cannot place underscores at the beginning or end of a number, nor can you place two underscores in a row.

  ```js
  let pi = _3.1415; // Error
  let pi = 3._1415; // Error
  let pi = 3.__1415; // Error
  ```

## Converting Strings with Underscores to Numbers

Be aware that when converting strings containing underscores to a number, JavaScript won't work as expected. For example:

```js
let numString = "230_000";
let num = Number(numString);
console.log(num); // NaN
```

This will return `NaN` (Not a Number) because JavaScript doesn't parse underscores in strings. The same behavior applies to `parseInt`:

```js
let numString = "230_000";
let num = parseInt(numString);
console.log(num); // 230
```

In this case, `parseInt` will ignore everything after the underscore, which may introduce bugs in your application.

## Conclusion

- **Numeric separators** (underscores) make it easier to read and understand large numbers.
- **Rules for placement**: underscores can be placed between digits, but not at the beginning or end, and not consecutively.
- Be cautious when dealing with **strings** that contain numeric separators, as they may cause parsing errors.

Use numeric separators in your code to improve readability, but avoid using them when working with strings that will be converted to numbers (e.g., in API responses).
