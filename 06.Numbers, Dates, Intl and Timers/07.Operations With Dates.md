# Date Calculations in JavaScript

In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform date calculations using JavaScript, including how to calculate the number of days between two dates.

## Overview

Dates in JavaScript are represented by `Date` objects. These objects can be manipulated and used to perform various calculations. One of the key aspects of date calculations involves converting dates to timestamps in milliseconds, allowing us to perform arithmetic operations such as subtraction to determine the number of days, hours, or minutes between two dates.

## Working with Dates

### Converting Date to a Timestamp

Whenever a `Date` object is converted to a number, it returns the timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). We can subtract two dates to get the difference in milliseconds.

Example:

```javascript
const date1 = new Date("2025-04-14");
const date2 = new Date("2025-04-24");
console.log(date2 - date1); // Outputs the difference in milliseconds
```

### Converting Milliseconds to Days

To convert the difference from milliseconds to days, we divide by the appropriate values:

- 1000 milliseconds = 1 second
- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour
- 24 hours = 1 day

```javascript
const milliseconds = date2 - date1;
const days = milliseconds / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
console.log(days); // Outputs the difference in days
```

### Absolute Difference

To handle cases where dates could be in reverse order (e.g., the second date is earlier), we can use `Math.abs()` to return the absolute difference.

Example:

```javascript
const daysPassed = Math.abs(date2 - date1) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
console.log(daysPassed); // Outputs the absolute number of days
```

## Example: Days Passed Function

We can create a function that calculates the number of days between two dates.

```javascript
const daysPassed = (date1, date2) => {
  return Math.abs(date2 - date1) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
};

const date1 = new Date("2025-04-14");
const date2 = new Date("2025-04-24");
console.log(daysPassed(date1, date2)); // Outputs 10
```

### Handling Time Differences

If one of the dates includes a specific time, it may affect the result. For example, if the second date is at 10:08 AM, it may show a decimal value for the days passed.

You can round the result using `Math.round()` to get the nearest whole number of days.

```javascript
const days = Math.round(daysPassed(date1, date2));
console.log(days); // Outputs the rounded number of days
```

## Formatting Dates for Display

You might want to display dates in a more user-friendly format, such as "Today", "Yesterday", or "X days ago". Here's how to implement that functionality.

### Format Movement Date Function

```javascript
const formatMovementDate = (date) => {
  const today = new Date();
  const daysPast = Math.round(daysPassed(date, today));

  if (daysPast === 0) {
    return "Today";
  } else if (daysPast === 1) {
    return "Yesterday";
  } else if (daysPast <= 7) {
    return `${daysPast} days ago`;
  } else {
    return date.toLocaleDateString(); // Return the full date if more than 7 days have passed
  }
};

const movementDate = new Date("2025-04-24");
console.log(formatMovementDate(movementDate)); // Outputs "Today", "Yesterday", or "X days ago"
```

### Displaying Movement Dates

You can use the `formatMovementDate` function to display formatted dates in your application.

Example:

```javascript
const dates = [
  new Date("2025-04-24"), // today
  new Date("2025-04-23"), // yesterday
  new Date("2025-04-19"), // 5 days ago
  new Date("2025-04-10"), // 14 days ago
];

dates.forEach((date) => {
  console.log(formatMovementDate(date));
});
```

## Conclusion

By using the methods and functions above, you can easily perform date calculations in JavaScript and format dates for display in a user-friendly manner. This approach works well for simple date calculations, but for more complex cases (such as handling time zone differences), you may want to use a date library like `Moment.js`.
