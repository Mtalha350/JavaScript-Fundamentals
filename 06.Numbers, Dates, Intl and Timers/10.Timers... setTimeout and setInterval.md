# Timers in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are two types of timers:

1. `setTimeout` - Executes a function once after a specified delay.
2. `setInterval` - Executes a function repeatedly at specified intervals.

## `setTimeout` - A One-time Timer

The `setTimeout` function allows us to execute code after a specific delay. For example, let's simulate ordering a pizza.

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Here is your pizza 🍕");
}, 3000);
```

In this example, after 3 seconds, the pizza emoji will appear in the console.

### Key Points:

- The function you pass into `setTimeout` is a callback function.
- The second argument (in milliseconds) specifies the delay before executing the callback.
- Code execution doesn't pause; the timer runs in the background.

### Passing Arguments to the Callback

If you need to pass arguments to the callback, `setTimeout` can handle that too:

```javascript
setTimeout(
  (ingredient1, ingredient2) => {
    console.log(`Pizza with ${ingredient1} and ${ingredient2}`);
  },
  3000,
  "Olives",
  "Spinach"
);
```

Here, after 3 seconds, the console will log the pizza with the specified ingredients.

### Clearing the Timer

You can cancel a `setTimeout` before the delay ends. To do this, store the timer ID in a variable:

```javascript
let pizzaTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Here is your pizza 🍕");
}, 3000);

let ingredients = ["Olives", "Spinach"];
if (ingredients.includes("Spinach")) {
  clearTimeout(pizzaTimer);
  console.log("Timer canceled - no spinach pizza!");
}
```

If the `ingredients` array contains spinach, the timer is canceled, and the pizza message doesn't appear.

## `setInterval` - A Repeating Timer

If you want a function to run repeatedly at a specific interval, use `setInterval`.

For example, let's log the current date every second:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  let now = new Date();
  console.log(now);
}, 1000);
```

In this example, the current date will be logged to the console every second.

### Key Points:

- `setInterval` repeats the callback function at the specified interval (in milliseconds).
- You can stop the interval using `clearInterval`:

```javascript
let timer = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Tick");
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
  clearInterval(timer);
  console.log("Interval cleared");
}, 5000); // Stops after 5 seconds
```

## Challenge: Build a Real Clock

Using `setInterval`, try to build a real clock that logs the current hour, minute, and second. This is a great exercise to practice your skills!
