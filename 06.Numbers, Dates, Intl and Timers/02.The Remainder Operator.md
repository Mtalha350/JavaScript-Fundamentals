# Remainder Operator in JavaScript

## What is the Remainder Operator?

The remainder operator (`%`), also known as the modulus operator, is used to find the remainder of a division operation.

### Example 1: 5 % 2

```js
5 % 2; // Output: 1
```

- 5 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 2 (integer part).
- Multiply 2 by 2 to get 4.
- The remainder is `5 - 4 = 1`.

### Example 2: 8 % 3

```js
8 % 3; // Output: 2
```

- 8 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2.
- Multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.
- The remainder is `8 - 6 = 2`.

## Checking Even or Odd Numbers

The remainder operator is often used to check if a number is **even** or **odd**.

### Even Numbers

- A number is **even** if the remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.

```js
6 % 2; // Output: 0 (even number)
```

### Odd Numbers

- A number is **odd** if the remainder when divided by 2 is `1`.

```js
7 % 2; // Output: 1 (odd number)
```

### Function to Check Even or Odd

```js
const isEven = (n) => n % 2 === 0;
```

Test cases:

```js
isEven(8); // true
isEven(23); // false
```

## Practical Application: Coloring Every Nth Row

The remainder operator can be used in real-world applications such as styling every nth element.

### Example: Color Every Second Row

```js
const rows = document.querySelectorAll(".row");
const rowsArray = [...rows]; // Convert NodeList to Array

rowsArray.forEach((row, index) => {
  if (index % 2 === 0) {
    row.style.backgroundColor = "orangeRed";
  }
});
```

### Example: Color Every Third Row

```js
rowsArray.forEach((row, index) => {
  if (index % 3 === 0) {
    row.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

- The **remainder operator** is crucial for various tasks, especially when determining if numbers are divisible by others or when working with patterns like coloring every nth item.
- It's useful for tasks where you need to operate every Nth element, e.g., highlighting rows in a table, checking divisibility, etc.
