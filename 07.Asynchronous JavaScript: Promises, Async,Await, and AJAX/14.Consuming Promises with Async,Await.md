# Notes Summary: Async/Await in JavaScript

## Introduction to Async/Await

* `async/await` was introduced in ES2017.
* It allows us to consume promises in a cleaner, more readable way.
* `async` functions return a promise automatically.

## Structure of an Async Function

```js
async function whereAmI(country) {
  // code here
}
```

* Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword.
* `await` pauses execution of the `async` function until the promise is settled.

## Fetching Country Data Using Async/Await

```js
const res = await fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data[0]);
renderCountry(data[0]);
```

* Awaiting the fetch returns a Response object.
* We then await the `.json()` method to get the actual data.

## Demonstrating Async Execution

```js
whereAmI('Portugal');
console.log('FIRST');
```

* Even though `whereAmI` is called first, `console.log('FIRST')` executes before the response is logged due to the asynchronous nature of `async` functions.

## Full Integration with Geolocation and Reverse Geocoding

* We promisified geolocation:

```js
const getPosition = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject)
);
```

* Inside our async function:

```js
const pos = await getPosition();
const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = pos.coords;

const resGeo = await fetch(`https://geocode.xyz/${lat},${lng}?geoit=json&auth=API_KEY`);
const dataGeo = await resGeo.json();

const res = await fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${dataGeo.country}`);
const data = await res.json();
renderCountry(data[0]);
```

## Error Handling

* Currently no error handling; if the reverse geocoding API is throttled (e.g., >3 req/sec), it breaks.
* Error handling is crucial to avoid a cascade of failures.

## Key Benefits

* Makes asynchronous code look synchronous.
* More readable and maintainable.
* Easier to debug and understand.

## Note

* `async/await` is syntactic sugar over `then()`.
* It does not change how promises work behind the scenes.
* Understanding promises deeply is essential to use `async/await` effectively.
