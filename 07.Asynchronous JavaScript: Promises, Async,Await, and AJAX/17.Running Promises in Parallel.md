# Async/Await and Promise Combinators: Fetching Multiple Countries in Parallel

## Goal

Create an async function that fetches data about three countries in parallel and logs their capital cities in an array.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Define the `get3Countries` Async Function

```js
async function get3Countries(c1, c2, c3) {
  try {
    const data = await Promise.all([
      getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c1}`),
      getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c2}`),
      getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${c3}`),
    ]);

    console.log(data.map(d => d[0].capital[0]));
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```

### 2. Explanation

* `Promise.all()` runs all promises in parallel.
* Returns a single promise that resolves when all promises succeed.
* If one promise fails, the entire `Promise.all()` rejects (short-circuits).
* `getJSON()` is assumed to be a helper function that fetches and parses JSON, while also handling fetch errors.

### 3. Example Call

```js
get3Countries('portugal', 'canada', 'tanzania');
// Output: ["Lisbon", "Ottawa", "Dodoma"]
```

### 4. Benefits of Running in Parallel

* Efficient and faster than running fetch requests sequentially.
* Ideal when requests are independent of each other.

### 5. Key Notes

* Avoid running async operations in sequence unless necessary.
* Use `try...catch` to handle errors in async functions.
* `Promise.all()` is a **combinator function**, as it combines multiple promises into one.

### 6. Alternative Syntax with `.then()`

```js
Promise.all([
  getJSON(url1),
  getJSON(url2),
  getJSON(url3)
]).then(data => {
  console.log(data.map(d => d[0].capital[0]));
}).catch(err => console.error(err));
```

---

## Summary

Use `Promise.all()` to run multiple independent async operations in parallel for better performance. This is particularly useful when fetching multiple pieces of data that don't rely on one another.
