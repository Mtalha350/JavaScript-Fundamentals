# JavaScript Asynchronous Runtime: Behind the Scenes

## Summary

This lecture dives deep into how JavaScript handles asynchronous code behind the scenes, breaking down the JavaScript runtime components and the flow of asynchronous operations.

### 1. **JavaScript Runtime Overview**

* **JavaScript Runtime**: A container with everything needed to run JS code.
* **Core Components**:

  * **Engine**: Executes code and manages memory (Call Stack & Heap).
  * **Web APIs**: DOM, Timers, Fetch, etc. (not part of JS language).
  * **Callback Queue**: Holds callbacks from events (load, click, timers).
  * **Event Loop**: Coordinates execution between Call Stack and Callback Queue.

### 2. **Single Threaded Nature**

* JS has only **one thread** of execution (no true multitasking).
* Asynchronous behavior is achieved through **non-blocking** architecture with Web APIs, Event Loop, and queues.

### 3. **Web APIs and Asynchronous Tasks**

* Async operations (e.g., `img.src = "dog.jpg"`, `fetch`) are handled in the **Web API environment**.
* These tasks donâ€™t block the Call Stack; they run in the background.

### 4. **Callback Registration and Execution**

* Using `addEventListener`, we register a **callback** in Web APIs.
* Once the async task completes, the callback is moved to the **Callback Queue**.
* When the Call Stack is empty, the **Event Loop** moves the callback from the queue to the stack for execution.

### 5. **Timers and Execution Delay**

* Timer durations are **not guaranteed** due to queue wait times.
* Actual execution time = Timer delay + Time taken for other queued callbacks to finish.

### 6. **DOM Events in the Callback Queue**

* Clicks and keypresses use the **Callback Queue** even though not strictly asynchronous.

### 7. **Microtasks Queue and Promises**

* Promise callbacks (e.g., `.then()`) go into the **Microtasks Queue**.
* **Microtasks have priority** over the Callback Queue.
* At the end of each Event Loop tick, all Microtasks are processed **before** any callbacks.

### 8. **Starvation of Callback Queue**

* If Microtasks continuously enqueue more Microtasks, the Callback Queue can get **starved**.
* This is rare in practice but can be a notable interview question.

### 9. **Execution Flow Recap**

* Image loads in Web API, callback is registered.
* Callback waits in Callback Queue.
* Event Loop checks Call Stack -> empty -> executes callback.
* Promises use Microtasks Queue which has **execution priority**.

### 10. **Conclusion**

* Understanding the JS Runtime, Event Loop, and queue mechanisms is essential.
* Helps write efficient, non-blocking code and prepares you for technical interviews.
