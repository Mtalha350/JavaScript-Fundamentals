# 🌐 AJAX Calls & Callback Hell – Notes

## 🚀 Goal
- Fetch a country using an AJAX request.
- After receiving the data, fetch one **neighboring country** using the `borders` property.
- Render both countries sequentially.

---

## ✅ Steps

### 1. Create `renderCountry(data, className = '')`
- Reusable function to render country data.
- `className` helps differentiate neighbors visually.

### 2. Define `getCountryAndNeighbor(country)`
#### 🔹 AJAX Call 1 (by name)
- Fetch country data via `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country}`.
- Extract neighbor code using:  
  ```js
  const [neighbor] = data.borders || [];
````

* If no neighbor: `return`.

#### 🔹 AJAX Call 2 (by code)

* Fetch neighbor using `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/{code}`.
* Neighbor data is a single object, not an array.

## 🔁 Nested Callbacks = Callback Hell

### 🔻 What is Callback Hell?

* When callbacks are **nested inside each other**.
* Hard to read, maintain, and debug.

### 🔻 Example:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('1 sec passed');
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('2 sec passed');
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('3 sec passed');
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

* Creates a **triangular structure**.
* Hard to manage more than a few levels deep.

---

## 🔧 Why It’s Bad

* Hard to read & understand.
* Difficult to maintain.
* Error-prone.
* Adding features becomes complex.

---

## 🛠 Solution: Promises

* Introduced in **ES6**.
* Allow handling async operations in a cleaner, more linear way.
* Help avoid deeply nested structures.

## 📝 Summary

| Concept         | Description            |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| AJAX Call 1     | Fetch country by name  |
| Get Border Code | `data.borders[0]`      |
| AJAX Call 2     | Fetch neighbor by code |
| Problem         | Callback Hell          |
| Solution        | Use Promises instead   |
