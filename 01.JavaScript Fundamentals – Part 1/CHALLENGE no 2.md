# CHALLENGE #2

## Description

This challenge builds upon the BMI example from Challenge #1, improving the console output by displaying a message indicating who has the higher BMI. The output must use template literals to include the exact BMI values.

## Key Requirements

1. Compare the BMI values of Mark and John.
2. Print one of the following messages to the console based on the comparison:
   - "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!"
   - "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
3. Modify the output to use template literals, including the BMI values in the message.
4. The BMI formula to use: `mass / (height * height)` (without the `**` operator).

## Example Output

- "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
- "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!"

## Important Notes

- Do **not** round the BMI values; use them as they are.
- Follow the correct formula without using exponentiation (`**`).
- The challenge reinforces the use of `if-else` statements and template literals for better readability and dynamic output in JavaScript.
