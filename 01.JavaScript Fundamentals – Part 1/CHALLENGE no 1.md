# CHALLENGE #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

**BMI = mass / (height \* height)**  
_(mass in kg and height in meters)_

## Your Task

Write some code to help them:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called `massMark`, `heightMark`, `massJohn`, and `heightJohn`.
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn`.
3. Log the value of `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn` to the console.

### Bonus Task

- Create a boolean variable `markHigherBMI` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
- Log it to the console too.

## Test Data

### Test Data 1:

- Mark weighs **78 kg** and is **1.69 m** tall.
- John weighs **92 kg** and is **1.95 m** tall.

### Test Data 2:

- Mark weighs **95 kg** and is **1.88 m** tall.
- John weighs **85 kg** and is **1.76 m** tall.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:

The `**` operator (exponentiation) is **not** supported in this editor.  
Make sure to use exactly this formula: `mass / (height * height)`,  
and **not** this one: `mass / (height ** 2)`.
