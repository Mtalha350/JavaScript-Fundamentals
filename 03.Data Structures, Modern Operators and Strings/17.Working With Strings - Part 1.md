# Strings in JavaScript

## Introduction

Over the next few lectures, we will learn how to work with strings and explore a couple of useful string methods. I could have divided this part about strings into many more lectures and gone really deep into some topics, but I think it's best to quickly introduce you to all the topics here and then keep using them in future projects. We work with strings all the time in JavaScript, so you will see these methods being used all the time throughout the rest of the course.

This is going to be really fun, so let's get started!

In this section, weâ€™re going to leave the restaurant theme behind and work on stuff related to airplanes and airlines. So that's something I really like!

Let's now start by creating an `airline` variable. I'm using `TAP Air Portugal`. If you'd like, you can use another one from your country, but you may need to adapt the examples.

As a plane, I'm using a string `A320`.

```javascript
let airline = "TAP Air Portugal";
let plane = "A320";
```

## String Operations

### Accessing Characters in a String

Just like in arrays, we can get the character of a string at a certain position. For example, in the `plane` string at position 0, the character should be `A`.

```javascript
console.log(plane[0]); // Output: A
console.log(plane[1]); // Output: 3
console.log(plane[2]); // Output: 2
```

These characters are still strings. If we want them to be numbers, we would need to convert them.

```javascript
let plane2 = "B727";
console.log(plane2[0]); // Output: B
```

### String Length

We can also read the `length` property of strings, just like we can in arrays.

```javascript
console.log(airline.length); // Output: 15
```

### Index Methods

Strings have methods that are quite similar to array methods. One of them is `indexOf`, which returns the position of a character or substring in the string.

```javascript
console.log(airline.indexOf("r")); // Output: 6
```

This works the same as arrays, as strings are zero-based.

We can also use `lastIndexOf` to get the last occurrence.

```javascript
console.log(airline.lastIndexOf("r")); // Output: 10
```

### Searching for Words

You can search for entire words within a string using methods like `indexOf`.

```javascript
console.log(airline.indexOf("Portugal")); // Output: 8
console.log(airline.indexOf("portugal")); // Output: -1 (case sensitive)
```

### Slicing Strings

We can extract part of a string using the `slice` method, which takes two parameters: the start index and the end index.

```javascript
console.log(airline.slice(4)); // Output: Air Portugal
console.log(airline.slice(4, 7)); // Output: Air
```

- The `start` parameter defines where the extraction will begin.
- The `end` parameter is not included in the result.

### Negative Indexes with Slice

We can also use negative numbers to slice strings from the end.

```javascript
console.log(airline.slice(-3)); // Output: gal
console.log(airline.slice(0, -3)); // Output: TAP Air Por
```

### Dynamic Slicing

Let's extract the first and last words without hardcoding the values.

```javascript
let firstWord = airline.slice(0, airline.indexOf(" ")); // First word
let lastWord = airline.slice(airline.lastIndexOf(" ") + 1); // Last word
console.log(firstWord); // Output: TAP
console.log(lastWord); // Output: Portugal
```

### Functions with Strings

Let's write a function that checks whether a seat is a middle seat in an airplane. For small planes, like the A320 or Boeing 737, the middle seats are `B` and `E`.

```javascript
function checkMiddleSeat(seat) {
  const seatLetter = seat.slice(-1);
  if (seatLetter === "B" || seatLetter === "E") {
    console.log("You got the middle seat! ðŸ˜¬");
  } else {
    console.log("You got lucky! ðŸ˜Š");
  }
}

checkMiddleSeat("23C"); // You got lucky!
checkMiddleSeat("3E"); // You got the middle seat! ðŸ˜¬
```

### Explanation Behind String Methods

You might wonder, since strings are primitives, why do they have methods? The answer is that JavaScript is smart. When we call a method on a string, JavaScript automatically converts the string primitive into a string object, behind the scenes. This process is called **boxing**, and after the operation, the string is converted back into a primitive.

### Example of Boxing

```javascript
let str = "hello";
let objStr = new String(str); // Boxing the string
console.log(objStr); // Object with string content
```

### Conclusion

Now you know how to work with strings and how to manipulate them using methods like `indexOf`, `slice`, and more. These string methods are essential for many tasks in JavaScript. Practice using them in different scenarios to get more familiar with how they work.
