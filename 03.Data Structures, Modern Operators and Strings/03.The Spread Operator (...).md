# The Amazing Spread Operator

Let's now talk about the amazing spread operator.

The spread operator can be used to expand an array into all its elements. Essentially, it helps in unpacking all the array elements at once.

### Example: Expanding an Array

Let's say we have an array `[7, 8, 9]`, and we want to create a new array based on this one but with some new elements at the beginning.

With what we know already, we would need to loop over this array or even worse, do it manually like this:

```javascript
let arr = [7, 8, 9];
let badNewArray = [1, 2, arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]];
console.log(badNewArray); // [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
```

This is quite a common operation, but with ES6, we can now do it much better using the spread operator.

```javascript
let newArray = [1, 2, ...arr];
console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
```

### How Does the Spread Operator Work?

What the spread operator does is take all the values out of `arr` and then write them individually in the new array.

Without the three dots (`...`), we would just get the entire array inside another array:

```javascript
let wrongArray = [1, 2, arr];
console.log(wrongArray); // [1, 2, [7, 8, 9]]
```

Using the spread operator, we "unpack" the array into individual elements.

### Use Cases for the Spread Operator

1. **Expanding Arrays in Functions**

   We can use the spread operator when passing arguments into functions. For instance, logging individual elements of an array:

```javascript
let newArray = [1, 2, 7, 8, 9];
console.log(...newArray); // 1 2 7 8 9
```

2. **Creating New Arrays**

   Let's say we want to create a new menu with an additional food item:

```javascript
let restaurant = {
  mainMenu: ["Pizza", "Burger", "Pasta"],
};

let newMenu = [...restaurant.mainMenu, "Gnocci"];
console.log(newMenu); // ['Pizza', 'Burger', 'Pasta', 'Gnocci']
```

Note that we are not modifying the original `mainMenu` array; we are creating a completely new array.

### Spread Operator vs Destructuring

The spread operator is somewhat similar to destructuring, but there are key differences:

- The spread operator takes all elements from the array and doesn't create new variables.
- It can only be used where we would otherwise write values separated by commas (e.g., when creating a new array or passing arguments into a function).

### Useful Operations with Spread Operator

1. **Shallow Copy of Arrays**

   To create a shallow copy of an array:

```javascript
let mainMenuCopy = [...restaurant.mainMenu];
console.log(mainMenuCopy); // ['Pizza', 'Burger', 'Pasta']
```

2. **Merging Two Arrays**

   To join two arrays together:

```javascript
let starterMenu = ["Salad", "Soup"];
let menu = [...starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];
console.log(menu); // ['Salad', 'Soup', 'Pizza', 'Burger', 'Pasta']
```

3. **Working with Iterables**

   The spread operator works not only on arrays but also on other iterables like strings, maps, and sets, but not objects.

   Example with strings:

```javascript
let str = "Jonas";
let letters = ["S", ...str];
console.log(letters); // ['S', 'J', 'o', 'n', 'a', 's']
```

### Objects and the Spread Operator

Although objects are not iterables, the spread operator can still be used on objects starting from ES2018.

Example:

```javascript
let restaurant = {
  name: "Italian Bistro",
  mainMenu: ["Pizza", "Burger", "Pasta"],
};

let newRestaurant = {
  ...restaurant,
  founder: "Giuseppe",
  foundedIn: 1998,
};

console.log(newRestaurant);
// { name: 'Italian Bistro', mainMenu: ['Pizza', 'Burger', 'Pasta'], founder: 'Giuseppe', foundedIn: 1998 }
```

### Copying Objects with the Spread Operator

Just like arrays, we can create shallow copies of objects:

```javascript
let restaurantCopy = { ...restaurant };
restaurantCopy.name = "Ristorante Roma";
console.log(restaurantCopy.name); // 'Ristorante Roma'
console.log(restaurant.name); // 'Italian Bistro'
```

### Conclusion

The spread operator is an amazing addition to the JavaScript language. It simplifies operations like expanding arrays, creating shallow copies, and merging arrays or objects. The spread operator works with arrays, strings, maps, and sets, but not objects (with the exception of object spread introduced in ES2018).
