# Working With Strings - Part 3

This is the third and final part of Working With Strings.

And let's start by learning about one of the most powerful string methods, which is `split`.

## The `split` Method

The `split` method allows us to split a string into multiple parts based on a divider string.

### Example:

```javascript
let str = "A+very+nice+string";
let result = str.split("+");
console.log(result); // ["A", "very", "nice", "string"]
```

In this example, the string is split by the "+" character and stored as an array. This method is really useful for dividing strings into multiple parts based on a specific character.

### Example with Name Split:

```javascript
let name = "Muhammad Talha";
let [firstName, lastName] = name.split(" ");
console.log(firstName); // "Muhammad"
console.log(lastName); // "Talha"
```

We can also use destructuring to directly assign the split values to variables. This is an easy way to split and assign parts of a string.

## The `join` Method

The `join` method is essentially the opposite of `split`. It allows us to join an array of strings back into a single string with a specified separator.

### Example:

```javascript
let nameParts = ["Mr.", "Muhammad", "TALHA"];
let fullName = nameParts.join(" ");
console.log(fullName); // "Mr. Muhammad TALHA"
```

The `join` method joins the elements of an array into one string with a separator of your choice.

### Using Split and Join to Capitalize a Name:

Here's how to use `split` and `join` together to capitalize a name:

```javascript
function capitalizeName(name) {
  let names = name.split(" ");
  let capitalizedNames = names.map(
    (n) => n.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + n.slice(1).toLowerCase()
  );
  return capitalizedNames.join(" ");
}

console.log(capitalizeName("jessica ann smith davis")); // "Jessica Ann Smith Davis"
```

This function splits the name into parts, capitalizes each part, and then joins them back together into a single string.

## Padding a String

Padding means to add extra characters to a string until it reaches a certain length.

### Example with `padStart`:

```javascript
let message = "go to gate 23";
let paddedMessage = message.padStart(25, "+");
console.log(paddedMessage); // "++++go to gate 23"
```

In this example, the `padStart` method adds "+" characters to the beginning of the string to make its total length 25.

### Example with `padEnd`:

```javascript
let paddedMessageEnd = message.padEnd(35, "+");
console.log(paddedMessageEnd); // "go to gate 23+++++++++"
```

The `padEnd` method works similarly, but it adds characters to the end of the string.

### Real-world Example: Masking Credit Card Numbers

To mask a credit card number, we can pad the string and reveal only the last four digits.

```javascript
function maskCreditCard(number) {
  let str = number.toString();
  return str.slice(-4).padStart(str.length, "*");
}

console.log(maskCreditCard(1234567812345678)); // "****5678"
```

Here, the first part of the number is replaced with asterisks to keep the number safe, and only the last four digits are visible.

## The `repeat` Method

The `repeat` method allows us to repeat a string multiple times.

### Example:

```javascript
let message = "Bad weather all departures delayed. ";
let repeatedMessage = message.repeat(5);
console.log(repeatedMessage);
// "Bad weather all departures delayed. Bad weather all departures delayed. ..."
```

This repeats the message five times, which could be used for a display message in airports or similar places.

### Fun Example with Planes in Line:

```javascript
function planesInLine(number) {
  let plane = "✈️";
  return plane.repeat(number);
}

console.log(planesInLine(5)); // "✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️"
console.log(planesInLine(3)); // "✈️✈️✈️"
console.log(planesInLine(12)); // "✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️"
```

## Conclusion

These methods `split`, `join`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `repeat`, and others are incredibly useful for manipulating strings. You can combine them to solve complex problems in a clean and efficient way.
