# Understanding the Rest Pattern and Rest Parameters in JavaScript

## Introduction

Let's talk about the rest pattern and rest parameters. The rest pattern looks exactly like the spread operator, having the same syntax with the three dots. However, it does the opposite of the spread operator. This might sound confusing at first, but I’ll explain it in detail.

## Spread vs. Rest

- The **spread operator** is used to _expand_ an array into individual elements.
- The **rest pattern** is used to _collect_ multiple elements and condense them into an array.

The rest pattern does the opposite of the spread operator. Let’s explore this with examples.

## Using the Rest Pattern

### Example 1: Destructuring Arrays with the Rest Pattern

In the previous lesson, we used the spread operator to build new arrays, like so:

```javascript
let newArray = [...oldArray];
```

We expand elements of `oldArray` into a new array. However, we can also use the spread syntax on the left-hand side of an assignment for destructuring. Here's an example:

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let [a, b, ...others] = array;

console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(others); // [3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements, and the remaining elements are collected into the `others` array. This is the **rest pattern**, which collects the unused elements from the array into a new array.

### Example 2: Destructuring with Skipped Elements

The rest pattern can also be used when we skip elements during destructuring:

```javascript
let menu = ["Pizza", "Risotto", "Pasta", "Salad"];

let [pizza, , risotto, ...otherFoods] = menu;

console.log(pizza); // Pizza
console.log(risotto); // Risotto
console.log(otherFoods); // ['Pasta', 'Salad']
```

The rest pattern only collects elements after the last variable in the destructuring assignment. Notice how skipped elements like `Pasta` are not included in the `otherFoods` array.

### Example 3: Rest Pattern in Objects

The rest pattern also works with objects. Let's destructure an object:

```javascript
const openingHours = {
  Monday: "9am - 5pm",
  Tuesday: "9am - 5pm",
  Saturday: "Closed",
  Sunday: "Closed",
};

const { Saturday, ...weekdays } = openingHours;

console.log(weekdays); // { Monday: '9am - 5pm', Tuesday: '9am - 5pm' }
```

Here, the `Saturday` property is destructured into its own variable, and the remaining properties are collected into the `weekdays` object.

## Rest Parameters in Functions

Just like the rest pattern in destructuring, the **rest parameters** syntax allows us to handle an arbitrary number of arguments in a function. Let's create a function that adds multiple numbers:

```javascript
function add(...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers); // [2, 3]
  return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(add(5, 3, 7, 2)); // 17
```

In this example, the `add` function takes any number of arguments, thanks to the rest parameter `...numbers`, and adds them together. The rest parameter collects all arguments passed into the function into an array.

### Example 4: Using Rest Parameters with Spread

We can also use the spread operator in combination with rest parameters:

```javascript
let ingredients = [23, 5, 7];

console.log(add(...ingredients)); // 35
```

Here, the spread operator `...ingredients` is used to pass the array elements as individual arguments to the `add` function, which then collects them into the `numbers` array using the rest parameter.

## Practical Example: Restaurant Order

Let’s apply rest parameters in a real-world example:

```javascript
function orderPizza(mainIngredient, ...otherIngredients) {
  console.log(mainIngredient); // mushrooms
  console.log(otherIngredients); // ['onion', 'olives', 'spinach']
}

orderPizza("mushrooms", "onion", "olives", "spinach");
```

In this function, the first argument is collected in the `mainIngredient` variable, and all other ingredients are collected into the `otherIngredients` array.

## Conclusion

To summarize:

- The **spread operator** is used to unpack an array or object into individual elements.
- The **rest pattern** is used to collect multiple elements into an array (for arrays) or object (for objects).
- **Rest parameters** allow us to handle an arbitrary number of arguments in functions.
