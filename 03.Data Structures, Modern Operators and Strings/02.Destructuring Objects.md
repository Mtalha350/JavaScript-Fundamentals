# Object Destructuring in JavaScript

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore how to destructure objects in JavaScript. Destructuring allows us to unpack properties from objects or arrays into distinct variables. This concept is quite powerful and can significantly reduce the amount of code you need to write when dealing with complex data structures.

## Destructuring Objects

### Basic Object Destructuring

We can use curly braces `{}` to destructure objects, just as we use square brackets `[]` for arrays. To destructure an object, we need to specify the property names we want to retrieve.

Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  name: "The Food Palace",
  categories: ["Italian", "Vegetarian", "Dessert"],
  openingHours: {
    Monday: { open: 9, close: 21 },
    Friday: { open: 11, close: 23 },
  },
};

// Destructuring the object
const { name, categories, openingHours } = restaurant;
console.log(name, categories, openingHours);
```

This will extract `name`, `categories`, and `openingHours` from the `restaurant` object. The destructured variables are created automatically based on the properties of the object.

### Renaming Variables

What if we want to assign different names to the destructured variables? We can easily do this by using the colon `:` syntax.

```javascript
const {
  name: restaurantName,
  categories: tags,
  openingHours: hours,
} = restaurant;
console.log(restaurantName, tags, hours);
```

In this example:

- `name` is renamed to `restaurantName`.
- `categories` is renamed to `tags`.
- `openingHours` is renamed to `hours`.

### Setting Default Values

Sometimes, we may need to destructure properties that may not exist in the object. In such cases, we can set default values.

```javascript
const { menu = [], starterMenu = [] } = restaurant;
console.log(menu, starterMenu);
```

In this case:

- `menu` does not exist on the `restaurant` object, so it defaults to an empty array.
- `starterMenu` exists, so the default value is not used.

### Mutating Variables During Destructuring

We can also mutate variables during object destructuring. However, if the variable already exists, we need to use parentheses to wrap the destructuring statement.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
const obj = { a: 23, b: 7, c: 14 };

// Mutating existing variables
({ a, b } = obj);
console.log(a, b);
```

### Nested Objects

Destructuring also works with nested objects. For example, if we want to destructure the opening hours for a specific day, we can access properties inside nested objects.

```javascript
const {
  openingHours: {
    Friday: { open, close },
  },
} = restaurant;
console.log(open, close);
```

Here, we are accessing `Friday` inside `openingHours`, and then extracting the `open` and `close` properties.

### Example with Renaming and Default Values

```javascript
const {
  openingHours: { Friday: { open: o, close: c } = { open: 0, close: 0 } },
} = restaurant;
console.log(o, c);
```

This example renames `open` to `o` and `close` to `c`, and also sets a default value for `Friday` in case it doesn't exist.

## Practical Application: Function Parameters

Destructuring objects can be particularly useful when dealing with function parameters. Instead of passing multiple parameters, we can pass a single object, which is then destructured inside the function.

```javascript
function orderDelivery({
  starterIndex = 0,
  mainIndex = 0,
  time = "20:00",
  address,
}) {
  console.log(
    `Order received! Starter: ${starterMenu[starterIndex]}, Main: ${mainMenu[mainIndex]}`
  );
  console.log(`Will be delivered to ${address} at ${time}`);
}

const options = {
  time: "23:30",
  address: "Via del Sole, 21",
  starterIndex: 1,
};

orderDelivery(options);
```

In this case:

- The function `orderDelivery` receives an object as a parameter.
- Inside the function, the object is immediately destructured, and default values are used if necessary.

This makes the code more readable and manageable, especially when the number of parameters increases.

## Conclusion

Destructuring objects in JavaScript is a powerful feature that helps to write cleaner and more efficient code. Whether you're extracting simple properties or dealing with nested structures, destructuring is a technique that will make working with objects much easier. Remember, you can rename variables, set default values, and even mutate existing variables during destructuring. This will come in handy when dealing with real-world data, especially when working with data from APIs or other external sources.
