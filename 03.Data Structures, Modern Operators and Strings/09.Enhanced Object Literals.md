# Enhanced Object Literals in JavaScript

In this section, we will explore the enhanced object literals introduced in ES6, which make it easier to work with object properties and methods. Let's go through the three major enhancements that ES6 brought to object literals.

### 1. Shorthand for Property Names

Before ES6, if you had an object that referenced another variable, you would write the property name and assign the variable explicitly:

```javascript
const openingHours = { thu: "12:00-22:00", fri: "12:00-22:00" };

const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  openingHours: openingHours,
};
```

In ES6, if the property name matches the variable name, you can use shorthand syntax and avoid repetition:

```javascript
const openingHours = { thu: "12:00-22:00", fri: "12:00-22:00" };

const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  openingHours, // Same as openingHours: openingHours
};
```

This shorthand syntax automatically adds the `openingHours` property to the `restaurant` object.

### 2. Simplified Method Definitions

In ES6, writing methods inside an object becomes simpler. Instead of using the traditional function expression syntax, you can now omit the `function` keyword:

Before ES6:

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};
```

After ES6:

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
};
```

This simplified syntax makes the code more concise and easier to read. It's a matter of personal preference, but many developers prefer this new, cleaner syntax.

### 3. Computed Property Names

In ES6, you can now compute property names dynamically, using expressions inside square brackets `[]`:

```javascript
const weekdays = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  openingHours: {
    [weekdays[3]]: "12:00-22:00", // Thursday
    [weekdays[4]]: "12:00-22:00", // Friday
  },
};

console.log(restaurant.openingHours);
```

In this case, the property names are computed using the values from the `weekdays` array. You can use any expression inside the square brackets to dynamically calculate property names.

### Example of Computed Property Names with Expressions

You can also compute property names using any expression, not just variables. For example:

```javascript
const restaurant = {
  name: "The Great Restaurant",
  openingHours: {
    [`Day ${2 + 2}`]: "12:00-22:00", // Day 4
    [`Day ${2 + 4}`]: "12:00-22:00", // Day 6
  },
};

console.log(restaurant.openingHours);
```

In this example, `Day 4` and `Day 6` are computed dynamically using expressions. This can be especially useful for creating dynamic property names.

### Conclusion

Enhanced object literals make working with objects in JavaScript easier and more concise. The three main improvements—shorthand property names, simplified method definitions, and computed property names—help streamline code, making it cleaner and more readable.
