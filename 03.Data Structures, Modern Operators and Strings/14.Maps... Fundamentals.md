# Introduction to Maps in JavaScript

So, we learned about sets. Now, it's time to learn about the other new JavaScript data structure, and that is **maps**. And, let me start by telling you that maps are a lot more useful than sets.

## What is a Map?

A map is a data structure that allows you to map values to keys. Just like an object, data is stored in key-value pairs in maps. However, the key difference between objects and maps is that in maps, the keys can have any type, whereas in objects, keys are usually always strings.

### Example of a Map

Let's create a restaurant map. We'll call it `rest`.

```javascript
let rest = new Map();
```

You can create an empty map like this, or you can fill it with data using the `set()` method.

```javascript
rest.set("name", "Classico Italiano");
```

In this example, we set the `name` key to map to "Classico Italiano."

### Keys in Maps

Maps are much more flexible than objects when it comes to the types of keys you can use. For instance, the keys can be numbers, objects, arrays, or even other maps.

```javascript
rest.set(1, "Firenze, Italy");
rest.set(2, "Lisbon, Portugal");
```

This is a map with numbers as keys.

### Chaining `set()` Method

The `set()` method returns the map itself, which means we can chain multiple `set()` calls together:

```javascript
rest
  .set("categories", ["Italian", "Pasta"])
  .set("open", 11)
  .set("close", 23)
  .set(true, "We are open")
  .set(false, "We are closed");
```

### Retrieving Data from a Map

To read data from a map, we use the `get()` method. You pass in the key to retrieve the corresponding value.

```javascript
console.log(rest.get(true)); // "We are open"
console.log(rest.get("name")); // "Classico Italiano"
```

### Conditional Mapping Based on Time

Now let's do something clever. We can use a map to determine if a restaurant is open or closed based on the current time.

```javascript
let currentTime = 21; // 9:00 PM
let isOpen =
  currentTime > rest.get("open") && currentTime < rest.get("close")
    ? rest.get(true)
    : rest.get(false);
console.log(isOpen); // "We are open"
```

### Additional Map Methods

Maps provide several useful methods:

- **`has(key)`**: Checks if a map contains a particular key.

  ```javascript
  console.log(rest.has("name")); // true
  ```

- **`delete(key)`**: Deletes an entry by its key.

  ```javascript
  rest.delete(2); // Deletes the Lisbon location
  ```

- **`size`**: Returns the number of entries in the map.

  ```javascript
  console.log(rest.size); // 6 (after deletion)
  ```

- **`clear()`**: Clears all entries from the map.

  ```javascript
  rest.clear();
  console.log(rest.size); // 0
  ```

### Using Objects and Arrays as Keys

One of the most interesting features of maps is that you can use **objects** or **arrays** as keys.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2];
rest.set(arr, "Test");
console.log(rest.get(arr)); // "Test"
```

But there's an important caveat here. The key in a map is not based on its content, but rather on its memory reference. So, if we use a different array (even with the same content), it won't work as a key.

```javascript
let arr2 = [1, 2];
console.log(rest.get(arr2)); // undefined
```

### Advanced Use: DOM Elements as Keys

You can even use **DOM elements** as map keys. For example:

```javascript
let heading = document.querySelector("h1");
rest.set(heading, "Heading Element");
console.log(rest.get(heading)); // "Heading Element"
```

This enables some advanced functionality where you can associate DOM elements directly with data in a map.

## Conclusion

We've learned how to create and work with maps in JavaScript. They are a powerful data structure, especially when compared to sets and objects. Maps allow you to have any type of key, making them more flexible and versatile for handling complex data.
