# Optional Chaining in JavaScript

Let's learn about an even newer feature of objects and arrays in JavaScript called **optional chaining**.

This feature is really amazing and helps us handle cases where certain properties or methods might be missing in an object or array without causing errors.

## The Problem Before Optional Chaining

Imagine that we want to get the opening hours of our restaurant for Monday:

```js
restaurant.openingHours.mon;
```

However, the `mon` property may not exist, and in this case, we get `undefined`. But in real-world situations, especially when data comes from a web API, we may not know if a particular restaurant opens on Monday or not.

Trying to access a nested property like this:

```js
restaurant.openingHours.mon.open;
```

will result in an error if `mon` is `undefined`. Before optional chaining, we would need to check if the `openingHours` or `mon` property exists to avoid this error.

### Without Optional Chaining (Using Conditional Logic)

We might write the following code to avoid the error:

```js
if (restaurant.openingHours && restaurant.openingHours.mon) {
  console.log(restaurant.openingHours.mon.open);
} else {
  console.log("Monday opening hours are unavailable.");
}
```

While this works, it can make the code harder to read and manage, especially with deeply nested objects.

## Optional Chaining

ES2020 introduced **optional chaining**, a feature that allows us to safely access properties and methods of objects and arrays that might not exist.

With optional chaining, we can access properties like this:

```js
restaurant.openingHours?.mon?.open;
```

Here, the `?.` operator ensures that if any part of the chain (`restaurant.openingHours` or `restaurant.openingHours.mon`) is `undefined` or `null`, the expression will return `undefined` immediately instead of throwing an error.

### Example

If `restaurant.openingHours` does not exist, the code will return `undefined` instead of causing an error. If the property exists, it will return the value.

```js
const openingHour = restaurant.openingHours?.mon?.open;
console.log(openingHour); // undefined if `mon` or `open` is missing
```

### Multiple Optional Chainings

You can chain multiple optional chaining operators to access deeply nested properties:

```js
restaurant.openingHours?.mon?.open;
```

This ensures that if any of the properties are missing, the whole expression will return `undefined`.

### Example with Arrays

Optional chaining also works with arrays. For example, you can check if an array element exists before trying to access its properties:

```js
const users = [{ name: "Jonas", email: "hello@Jonas.io" }];
const userName = users[0]?.name;
console.log(userName); // "Jonas"
```

If the array is empty, you can use optional chaining to avoid errors:

```js
const users = [];
const userName = users[0]?.name ?? "User array empty";
console.log(userName); // "User array empty"
```

### Optional Chaining with Methods

Optional chaining can also be used to safely call methods that might not exist:

```js
restaurant.order?.(0, 1);
```

If the `order` method exists, it will be called; otherwise, it will return `undefined` without causing an error.

### Combining Optional Chaining with Nullish Coalescing

Often, optional chaining is used together with the **nullish coalescing operator (`??`)** to provide default values when the result is `undefined` or `null`:

```js
const openingTime = restaurant.openingHours?.mon?.open ?? "Closed";
console.log(openingTime); // "Closed" if `open` is undefined or null
```

## Real-World Example

Imagine you have a `weekdays` array, and you want to check whether the restaurant is open or closed for each day:

```js
const weekdays = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"];

weekdays.forEach((day) => {
  const openHour = restaurant.openingHours?.[day]?.open ?? "Closed";
  console.log(`On ${day}, we open at ${openHour}`);
});
```

This approach ensures that if any property is missing, the code won't break and will simply display "Closed."

## Conclusion

Optional chaining is a powerful feature introduced in ES2020 that makes your code cleaner and more robust by safely handling `null` and `undefined` values. When used with the nullish coalescing operator, it makes it easy to provide default values and handle missing data gracefully.
