# Understanding Set Methods in ES2025

Until ES2025, sets only had four methods: `has`, `add`, `delete`, and `clear`. These methods were simple, and sets weren't that useful in many situations. In fact, I personally never used them much.

However, in ES2025, sets received seven new methods, making them a lot more useful, especially when combined with arrays. These new methods bring sets more in line with sets in other programming languages, where they are an essential data structure. In this lecture, we will briefly explore these new methods.

## Demo Overview

In this demonstration, we will work with two data structures that are present in the starter code: `ItalianFoods` and `MexicanFoods`.

```js
const italianFoods = new Set([
  "tomatoes",
  "garlic",
  "basil",
  "gnocchi",
  "olive oil",
]);
const mexicanFoods = new Set(["tomatoes", "garlic", "chili", "avocado"]);
```

We will use these sets to demonstrate new set operations.

## Intersection Method

The `intersection` method finds the common elements between two sets.

### Example:

```js
let commonFoods = italianFoods.intersection(mexicanFoods);
console.log("Intersection:", commonFoods);
```

The result will be a set containing only the common elements: `tomatoes` and `garlic`.

If we wanted an array of the common foods, we could use the spread operator:

```js
let commonFoodsArray = [...commonFoods];
console.log(commonFoodsArray); // Output: ['tomatoes', 'garlic']
```

This is a very useful operation, especially when working with arrays. Before the addition of this method, we would have had to create custom solutions using methods like `filter`. But now, with the `intersection` method, we can easily get the common elements between two sets or arrays.

## Union Method

The `union` method returns a new set containing all elements from both sets, without duplicates.

### Example:

```js
let italianAndMexicanFusion = italianFoods.union(mexicanFoods);
console.log("Union:", italianAndMexicanFusion);
```

This will return a set containing all unique elements from both `italianFoods` and `mexicanFoods`.

If you want to achieve the same result with arrays, you can combine the arrays first and then convert them into a set to remove duplicates:

```js
let allFoods = [...italianFoods, ...mexicanFoods];
let uniqueFoods = new Set(allFoods);
console.log([...uniqueFoods]); // Output: ['tomatoes', 'garlic', 'basil', 'gnocchi', 'olive oil', 'chili', 'avocado']
```

## Difference Method

The `difference` method returns a new set containing elements that are present in the first set but not in the second.

### Example:

```js
let uniqueItalianFoods = italianFoods.difference(mexicanFoods);
console.log("Unique Italian Foods:", uniqueItalianFoods);
```

This will give us the elements that are in the `italianFoods` set but not in the `mexicanFoods` set, which in this case are `['basil', 'gnocchi', 'olive oil']`.

Similarly, you can find unique Mexican foods:

```js
let uniqueMexicanFoods = mexicanFoods.difference(italianFoods);
console.log("Unique Mexican Foods:", uniqueMexicanFoods);
```

### Result:

```js
["chili", "avocado"];
```

## Symmetric Difference Method

The `symmetricDifference` method returns all elements that are in either of the two sets, but not in both.

### Example:

```js
let uniqueItalianAndMexicanFoods =
  italianFoods.symmetricDifference(mexicanFoods);
console.log("Unique Italian and Mexican Foods:", uniqueItalianAndMexicanFoods);
```

This will give us the unique elements from both sets:

```js
["basil", "gnocchi", "olive oil", "chili", "avocado"];
```

## Checking Set Relationships

There are three more methods to check relationships between sets:

1. `isSubsetOf()`: Checks if one set is a subset of another.
2. `isSupersetOf()`: Checks if one set is a superset of another.
3. `isDisjointFrom()`: Checks if two sets have no common elements.

### Example of `isDisjointFrom`:

```js
console.log(italianFoods.isDisjointFrom(mexicanFoods)); // false
```

Since `tomatoes` and `garlic` are common in both sets, this will return `false`.

These new set methods in ES2025 bring significant improvements to working with sets, especially when used alongside arrays. They are very similar to mathematical set operations and are highly useful in various applications.
