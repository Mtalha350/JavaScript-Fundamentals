# Logical Assignment Operators in JavaScript

In this section, we are going to explore three new **logical assignment operators** that were introduced in **ES 2021**. These operators allow for a more concise and readable way to assign values based on certain logical conditions. Let's dive into how they work.

### Restaurant Example

First, let's create two simple restaurant objects:

```javascript
let restaurant1 = {
  name: "The Great Eatery",
  numGuests: 20,
};

let restaurant2 = {
  name: "La Piazza",
  owner: "Giovanni Rossi",
};
```

We will set a default number of guests for restaurants that do not have this property. We’ll start by using the **OR operator** (`||`).

### Using the OR Operator

We know that the **OR operator** can be used to provide a default value if the left-hand value is falsy. Let's apply that:

```javascript
restaurant2.numGuests = restaurant1.numGuests || 10;
```

If `restaurant2.numGuests` does not exist, this will assign `10` as a default value.

#### Result:

- For `restaurant1`, the `numGuests` value is `20`, so it is not replaced.
- For `restaurant2`, the `numGuests` value does not exist, so it will be assigned `10`.

### OR Assignment Operator (`||=`)

The **OR Assignment operator** (`||=`) was introduced in ES2021, and it allows us to simplify the previous code into a more concise form:

```javascript
restaurant1.numGuests ||= 10;
restaurant2.numGuests ||= 10;
```

This is equivalent to:

```javascript
restaurant1.numGuests = restaurant1.numGuests || 10;
restaurant2.numGuests = restaurant2.numGuests || 10;
```

It assigns a value to the variable only if the variable is currently falsy (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, or `""`).

#### Issue with Zero (`0`)

Here’s a potential issue. If we set `restaurant1.numGuests` to `0`, the **OR Assignment operator** will still assign the default value of `10` because `0` is a falsy value.

```javascript
restaurant1.numGuests = 0; // This is falsy
restaurant1.numGuests ||= 10; // Will be set to 10
```

### Nullish Coalescing Assignment Operator (`??=`)

To solve the issue with zero, we can use the **Nullish Coalescing Assignment operator** (`??=`). This operator assigns a value only if the variable is **null** or **undefined**.

```javascript
restaurant1.numGuests ??= 10;
restaurant2.numGuests ??= 10;
```

This works as follows:

- If `restaurant1.numGuests` is `null` or `undefined`, it will be assigned `10`.
- If `restaurant1.numGuests` is `0` or an empty string, it will **not** be changed.

#### Example:

```javascript
restaurant1.numGuests = 0; // This is falsy, but not nullish
restaurant1.numGuests ??= 10; // It stays 0 because it's not null or undefined
```

### AND Assignment Operator (`&&=`)

The **AND Assignment operator** (`&&=`) works differently. It assigns a value only if the variable is **truthy**.

Let’s use this to anonymize the `owner` property of the restaurant:

```javascript
restaurant2.owner &&= "Anonymous";
```

If `restaurant2.owner` exists and is truthy, it will be replaced with "Anonymous". If `restaurant2.owner` is `undefined`, it will stay the same.

#### Example:

```javascript
restaurant1.owner &&= "Anonymous"; // Nothing happens because owner is undefined
restaurant2.owner &&= "Anonymous"; // Replaces Giovanni Rossi with "Anonymous"
```

This operator is useful when you want to assign a value only when the original value is truthy.

### Summary

- **OR Assignment (`||=`)**: Assigns a value if the variable is falsy.
- **Nullish Coalescing Assignment (`??=`)**: Assigns a value if the variable is null or undefined, but not if it’s zero or an empty string.
- **AND Assignment (`&&=`)**: Assigns a value only if the variable is truthy.

These logical assignment operators provide a cleaner and more concise way to handle default values and conditional assignments in JavaScript.
