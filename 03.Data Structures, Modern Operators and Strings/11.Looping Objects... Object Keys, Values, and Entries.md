# Understanding the `for...of` Loop in JavaScript

So we learned about the `for...of` loop to loop over a race, which, remember, is an Iterable.

But we can also loop over objects, which are not Iterable, but in an indirect way. Now we have different options here, depending on what exactly we want to loop over. So do we want to loop over the object's property names, values, or both together?

## Looping Over Property Names (Keys)

Let's start by simply looping over property names. These are also called **keys**. Ultimately, we will still have to use the `for...of` loop to loop over the array, but again, we are going to do that in an indirect way. We're not actually looping over the object itself, but we will loop over an array. Here's how:

```javascript
let day;
let properties = Object.keys(openingHours);
console.log(properties); // ['Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']

// Loop over the property names
for (let day of properties) {
  console.log(day); // Thursday, Friday, Saturday
}
```

### Explanation:

In the example above, `Object.keys()` is used to get an array of the keys (property names) of the `openingHours` object. We then use the `for...of` loop to iterate over this array and log each key.

We can also compute the number of properties in the object:

```javascript
console.log(`We are open on ${properties.length} days.`); // We are open on 3 days.
```

## Looping Over Property Values

What if we want the property values themselves? We can use `Object.values()` for this:

```javascript
let values = Object.values(openingHours);
console.log(values); // ['12-22', '12-22', '12-22']
```

### Explanation:

`Object.values()` gives us an array of the values for each property in the object. Now, we can loop over these values directly using `for...of`.

## Looping Over Both Keys and Values

To loop over both the keys and values together, we can use `Object.entries()`:

```javascript
let entries = Object.entries(openingHours);
console.log(entries); // [['Thursday', '12-22'], ['Friday', '12-22'], ['Saturday', '12-22']]
```

### Explanation:

`Object.entries()` transforms the object into an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains a key and its corresponding value. This makes it easy to loop over both the key and value together.

Hereâ€™s how we can loop over both keys and values:

```javascript
for (let [day, hours] of entries) {
  console.log(`On ${day}, we are open from ${hours}.`);
}
```

### Explanation:

We destructure each entry directly inside the loop to get both the key (`day`) and the value (`hours`). This allows us to format the output like:

```text
On Thursday, we are open from 12-22.
On Friday, we are open from 12-22.
On Saturday, we are open from 12-22.
```

## Conclusion

- **Property names (keys)**: Use `Object.keys()` to loop over property names.
- **Property values**: Use `Object.values()` to loop over values.
- **Both keys and values**: Use `Object.entries()` to loop over both keys and values together.

These methods combined with the `for...of` loop provide a powerful way to work with objects in JavaScript.
