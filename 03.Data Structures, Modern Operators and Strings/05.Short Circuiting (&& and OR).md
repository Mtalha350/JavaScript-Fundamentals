# Understanding Short Circuiting with AND & OR Operators

Let's go back to two logical operators that we have used before but haven't fully explored: the AND operator (`&&`) and the OR operator (`||`), and how we can leverage them for **short-circuiting**.

## Logical Operators & Their Full Potential

Up until now, we have used logical operators primarily to combine Boolean values. However, we can do much more with the AND and OR operators. Let's dive deeper.

### The OR Operator (`||`)

The OR operator can be used with non-Boolean values. For example:

```javascript
console.log(3 || "Jonas");
```

In this case, the result is `3`. This shows that the OR operator doesn't always return a Boolean value.

### Properties of Logical Operators

1. **Any Data Type**: Logical operators can work with any data type, not just Boolean values.
2. **Return Any Data Type**: They can return any data type as well.
3. **Short Circuiting**: Short circuiting (or short circuit evaluation) means that if the first operand is truthy (in the case of the OR operator), the second operand is never even evaluated.

#### Short Circuiting with the OR Operator

- If the first operand is truthy, the result will be the first operand.
- JavaScript will not evaluate the second operand.

Example:

```javascript
console.log("" || "Jonas"); // Result: Jonas
console.log(true || 0); // Result: true
console.log(undefined || null); // Result: null
```

### General Rule for the OR Operator

When using multiple operands with the OR operator, it will return the first truthy value:

```javascript
console.log(undefined || 0 || "" || "hello" || 23 || null); // Result: hello
```

In this case, "hello" is the first truthy value, so it is returned.

### Practical Application of the OR Operator

Consider the scenario where we want to set a default value for a property that might not exist:

```javascript
const restaurant = {};
const guests = restaurant.numGuests || 10;
console.log(guests); // Result: 10
```

This is a simpler way to assign default values than using a ternary operator or an `if-else` statement.

### Handling Edge Cases

The OR operator doesn't work as expected when the value is `0`, because `0` is a falsy value. This can be resolved in the next section.

### The AND Operator (`&&`)

The AND operator works in the opposite way to the OR operator in terms of short-circuiting. The AND operator will short-circuit if the first value is falsy:

```javascript
console.log(0 && "Jonas"); // Result: 0
```

If the first value is falsy, the result is immediately returned without evaluating the second operand.

#### Short Circuiting with the AND Operator

- If the first operand is falsy, the result will be the first operand.
- The second operand is not evaluated.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(23 && null && "Jonas"); // Result: null
```

### Practical Use of the AND Operator

We can use the AND operator to avoid writing explicit `if` statements. For example, if we want to check if a method exists before calling it:

```javascript
restaurant.orderPizza && restaurant.orderPizza("mushrooms", "spinach");
```

If `orderPizza` exists (i.e., it's a truthy value), the function will be called.

## Summary

- **OR Operator (`||`)**: Returns the first truthy value or the last value if all are falsy.
- **AND Operator (`&&`)**: Returns the first falsy value or the last value if all are truthy.
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Use the OR operator to set default values.
  - Use the AND operator to execute code only if the first operand is truthy.
