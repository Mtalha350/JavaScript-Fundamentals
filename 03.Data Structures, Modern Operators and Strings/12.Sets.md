# Understanding JavaScript Sets

In the past, JavaScript has always had very few built-in data structures. We primarily had objects and arrays. But in ES6, two more data structures were introduced: **Sets** and **Maps**.

### What is a Set?

A set is essentially a collection of unique values. This means a set can never contain duplicates, which makes them useful in certain situations.

### Creating a Set

To create a new set, you use the `new Set()` syntax. Sets can accept any iterable (arrays, strings, etc.) as input.

Example:

```javascript
let ordersSet = new Set([
  "pasta",
  "pizza",
  "pizza",
  "risotto",
  "pasta",
  "pizza",
]);
console.log(ordersSet);
```

This will output:

```
Set(3) { 'pasta', 'pizza', 'risotto' }
```

As you can see, the duplicate values (`'pizza'`, `'pasta'`) are removed automatically, leaving only the unique values.

### Properties of Sets

1. **Uniqueness**: All elements in a set must be unique.
2. **No Key-Value Pair**: Unlike objects or maps, sets don't store key-value pairs; they only store values.
3. **Order**: Sets do not guarantee the order of elements, though they may appear in the order they were added.

### Working with Sets

- **Size of a Set**: You can get the number of unique elements in a set using the `.size` property.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(ordersSet.size); // 3
```

- **Checking if an Element Exists**: You can check if a set contains a specific element using the `.has()` method.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(ordersSet.has("pizza")); // true
console.log(ordersSet.has("bread")); // false
```

- **Adding Elements**: You can add new elements using the `.add()` method. However, if you add a duplicate, it will be ignored.

Example:

```javascript
ordersSet.add("garlic bread");
console.log(ordersSet);
```

- **Deleting Elements**: You can remove elements from a set using the `.delete()` method.

Example:

```javascript
ordersSet.delete("risotto");
console.log(ordersSet);
```

- **Clearing a Set**: You can remove all elements from a set using the `.clear()` method.

### Retrieving Values from a Set

Unlike arrays, sets do not support indexing. You cannot retrieve values by index like you can with arrays.

Example:

```javascript
console.log(ordersSet[0]); // undefined
```

### Iterating Over a Set

Since sets are iterables, you can loop over their values using a `for...of` loop.

Example:

```javascript
for (let order of ordersSet) {
  console.log(order);
}
```

### Use Case: Removing Duplicates from an Array

One of the most common use cases for sets is removing duplicate values from an array. Let's say you have an array of staff positions in a restaurant, and you want to get the unique positions.

Example:

```javascript
let staff = ["waiter", "chef", "waiter", "manager", "chef", "waiter"];
let uniqueStaff = new Set(staff);
console.log(uniqueStaff);
```

To convert a set back into an array, you can use the spread operator.

Example:

```javascript
let uniqueStaffArray = [...uniqueStaff];
console.log(uniqueStaffArray);
```

### Conclusion

Sets are not intended to replace arrays. If you need to store values in order, and those values might contain duplicates, you should continue using arrays. However, sets are incredibly useful when you need to store unique values and can interact with them using straightforward methods.

Use sets when you need uniqueness, but arrays remain the go-to choice for most scenarios where order and duplicates are important.
