# Understanding Closures in JavaScript

There is an almost mystical feature of JavaScript functions that many developers fail to fully understand. And what I'm talking about is something called closures.

So when I ask my students what's the hardest JavaScript concept to understand, many people say that it's closures. However, I believe that with the right explanation, it's actually not that hard, especially when you already understood everything that you learned before in this course, such as execution context, the call stack, and the scope chain. Because closures kind of bring all of these concepts together in a beautiful, almost magical way.

So enough talk, let's see what closures are all about.

## The Secure Booking Example

I will start by creating a new function called `secureBooking`. It is this function that will create the closure.

The first thing that I need to tell you about closures is that a closure is not a feature that we explicitly use. So we don't create closures manually, like we create a new array or a new function. A closure simply happens automatically in certain situations. We just need to recognize those situations.

### Writing the Example

In this example, I am creating a variable `passengerCount` that starts at zero. This variable will be manipulated, but it will not be accessible from the outside. The `secureBooking` function will return a new function that updates this `passengerCount` variable.

```javascript
function secureBooking() {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(passengerCount);
  };
}

const booker = secureBooking();
```

### Analyzing the Code

When we execute the `secureBooking` function, a new execution context is placed on the call stack, and the variable environment containing the `passengerCount` is created. The scope chain will have access to this variable, along with the global scope.

Once the `secureBooking` function finishes executing, its execution context pops off the call stack. However, the variable environment containing `passengerCount` is still stored in memory.

### Calling the Booker Function

We call the `booker` function multiple times. Even though the `secureBooking` function has already finished executing, the `booker` function still has access to the `passengerCount` variable.

```javascript
booker(); // Output: 1
booker(); // Output: 2
booker(); // Output: 3
```

### What is Happening Behind the Scenes?

So how is it possible for the `booker` function to access `passengerCount` even though the `secureBooking` function has already finished executing? The answer lies in closures. A closure allows the inner function to remember the variables from the outer function even after it has finished execution.

### Memory Management and Garbage Collection

Once the execution context of `secureBooking` finishes, the function is gone. However, the variable environment containing `passengerCount` is moved to the heap and stays there because it is reachable by a closure.

In this case, the `passengerCount` variable cannot be garbage collected because it is being "held onto" by the closure.

### The Magic of Closures

The key to understanding closures is that they allow a function to always have access to its variable environment, even after the execution context has finished. The closure essentially "remembers" the variables from the function's birthplace, even after that function is no longer active.

### Closure Analogy

To help understand closures, consider this analogy:

- A function is like a person.
- The variables in its environment are like the person's hometown.
- Even after the person leaves their hometown, they still remember it.

In this analogy, the function (person) remembers the variables (hometown) in its parent scope even after that scope is no longer available.

### Another Closure Analogy

A closure can also be thought of as a backpack that a function carries around. This backpack contains all the variables from the function's creation environment. Whenever the function needs a variable, it looks in its backpack to find it.

### Final Thoughts on Closures

- We don't manually create closures; they happen automatically in JavaScript.
- A closure is an internal property of a function that allows it to access variables from its creation environment even after that environment is gone.
- Closures ensure that a function does not lose connection to the variables that existed at the time and place it was created.

So, to summarize:

- A closure is the closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone.
- Closures allow functions to access the variables of their parent functions, even after those parent functions have finished executing.
- Closures are a powerful and magical feature of JavaScript that help manage variables and memory efficiently.
