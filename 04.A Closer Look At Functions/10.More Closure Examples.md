# Understanding Closures in JavaScript

Let's now create two more situations in which closures are going to appear. So that you can start identifying closures in your own code in the future. Both of these examples demonstrate that we don't need to return a function from another function to create a closure.

## Example 1: Reassigning Functions

In this example, we're going to define an empty variable called `f` and then a function expression `g`. These are just some generic names because what the functions do here donâ€™t really matter.

```javascript
let f;
let g = function () {
  let a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

g(); // Call g function
f(); // Call f function
```

### Explanation:

1. `f` starts as an empty variable.
2. Inside function `g`, `f` is reassigned to be a function that logs `a * 2` to the console.
3. After calling `g`, the value of `f` is a function that accesses the variable `a` from the `g` function's scope.
4. When `f` is called, it logs `46`, which is `23 * 2`.

**Closure Explanation:**

- Even though `f` is defined outside of the `g` function, when `f` is reassigned inside `g`, it **closes over** the variable environment of `g` and has access to `a`.
- This proves that closures can be created even when the function is reassigned within another function.

### Key Takeaway:

A closure "remembers" the variables from its birthplace (the environment in which it was defined), even after that environment is no longer in scope.

## Example 2: Using Timers and Closures

Now, let's explore how closures appear in the case of timers, particularly with `setTimeout`. A timer is another great example that we don't need to return a function to see a closure in action.

```javascript
function boardPassengers(n, wait) {
  let perGroup = n / 3; // Assume passengers are divided into three groups

  console.log(`We will start boarding and wait ${wait} seconds.`);

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers.`);
    console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers.`);
  }, wait * 1000); // Wait in milliseconds
}

boardPassengers(180, 3); // 180 passengers, 3 seconds wait
```

### Explanation:

1. Inside the `boardPassengers` function, we create a variable `perGroup` to divide passengers into 3 groups.
2. `setTimeout` is used to execute a callback after a specified time (in this case, 3 seconds).
3. The callback logs `n` and `perGroup` values to the console, both of which were defined in the parent function `boardPassengers`.

**Closure Explanation:**

- The callback function passed to `setTimeout` has access to `n` and `perGroup` even after `boardPassengers` has finished executing. This is because `setTimeout` creates a closure over the environment where the callback was defined.
- This is a clear sign of closure creation, where the callback function can access the variables from the parent function, even after that function has completed.

### Priority Over Scope Chain:

- To demonstrate the closure's priority, let's add a global `perGroup` variable and see which one is used inside the closure.

```javascript
let perGroup = 1000; // Global variable

function boardPassengers(n, wait) {
  let perGroup = n / 3; // Local variable

  console.log(`We will start boarding and wait ${wait} seconds.`);

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers.`);
    console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers.`);
  }, wait * 1000);
}

boardPassengers(180, 3); // The local perGroup will be used, not the global one
```

**Key Point:**

- When the closure accesses `perGroup`, it uses the local `perGroup` variable, not the global one. This demonstrates that closures have priority over the scope chain.

### Conclusion:

- Closures are an important feature in JavaScript. Even if you don't return a function, closures can still be created when functions are reassigned or executed in certain contexts like timers.
- Understanding closures helps you to write better, more efficient code and makes debugging much easier.

Now that you have a better understanding of closures, it's time to practice identifying them in your own code. Keep an eye out for situations where functions are created inside other functions, and you'll begin to see closures appearing more often.
