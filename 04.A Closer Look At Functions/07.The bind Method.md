# Understanding JavaScript's `bind` Method

The `bind` method, similar to `call`, allows us to manually set the `this` keyword for any function call. However, unlike `call`, which immediately calls the function, `bind` does not invoke the function. Instead, it returns a new function where the `this` keyword is bound to the value passed into `bind`.

## Example: Airline Booking

### Initial Setup

Let's revisit the airline example from the previous lecture, where we use the `book` function for different airlines. In the previous example, we used the `call` method to invoke the `book` function with `this` set to the `Eurowings` object. Here’s the previous approach:

```javascript
book.call(Eurowings, "Steven Williams", 23);
```

### Using `bind`

Now, we can create a new function using `bind`, which will always have `this` set to `Eurowings`. The `bind` method doesn’t immediately call the function, but instead returns a new function.

```javascript
const bookEW = book.bind(Eurowings);
bookEW("Steven Williams", 23);
```

### Output:

This will result in the same output as before, where `Steven Williams` is booked on the `Eurowings` flight with the flight number `EW23`. The key difference is that `this` is already bound to `Eurowings`, so we no longer need to specify it.

### Creating Functions for Other Airlines

Using `bind`, we can create new functions for other airlines without having to repeatedly call `book` with the airline object. This simplifies booking flights for multiple airlines.

```javascript
const bookSwiss = book.bind(Swiss);
```

### Pre-setting Arguments with `bind`

In addition to setting `this`, `bind` also allows us to pre-set some arguments. This feature can be used to create more specific functions for things like booking a flight for a specific flight number.

```javascript
const bookEW23 = book.bind(Eurowings, 23);
bookEW23("Martha Cooper");
```

This approach pre-sets the flight number (`23`), so we only need to provide the passenger's name when calling the function.

### Partial Application

The concept of "partial application" comes into play here. Partial application allows us to create a new function by pre-setting some of the arguments, so the resulting function is simpler to use.

```javascript
const addVAT = addTax.bind(null, 0.23);
addVAT(200); // Adds VAT to 200
```

In the example above, the tax rate is preset to `23%`, making it easier to calculate VAT without needing to specify the tax rate each time.

### Using `bind` with Event Listeners

Another common use case for `bind` is when working with objects and event listeners. In an event handler function, `this` typically refers to the element the event is attached to. However, we may need to ensure that `this` refers to the correct object (e.g., `Lufthansa`) instead of the button element.

```javascript
button.addEventListener("click", lufthansa.buyPlane.bind(lufthansa));
```

This ensures that when the button is clicked, `this` inside `buyPlane` refers to the `Lufthansa` object.

### Conclusion

The `bind` method is a powerful tool in JavaScript. It allows us to set the `this` keyword manually and even pre-set function arguments. Whether you're simplifying repeated function calls or working with event listeners, `bind` is an essential method to understand for advanced JavaScript development.

#### Challenge:

Try to implement the same logic without using `bind` and instead use a function returning another function. This is a more advanced technique but can help you better understand how JavaScript handles function creation.
