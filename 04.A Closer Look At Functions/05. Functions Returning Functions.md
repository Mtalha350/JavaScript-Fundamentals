# JavaScript: Functions Returning Functions

In this lesson, we're doing the opposite of the previous one â€” **creating a function that returns a new function**.

Let's consider a basic example using a `greet` function to illustrate this concept.

## Basic `greet` Function

```js
function greet(greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
  };
}
```

### Explanation

- `greet` takes a `greeting` (e.g., "Hi", "Hello") as its parameter.
- It returns a **new function** that takes `name` as a parameter.
- The returned function prints a personalized greeting using both `greeting` and `name`.

### Using the Function

```js
const greeterHey = greet("Hey");

greeterHey("Jonas"); // Output: Hey Jonas
greeterHey("Steven"); // Output: Hey Steven
```

- `greeterHey` is now a function that remembers the original greeting ("Hey") thanks to **closures**.
- When we call `greeterHey('Jonas')`, it prints the full message.

## Closures

This works due to a concept in JavaScript called **closures**:

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

Even though `greet` has finished executing, its inner function still has access to the `greeting` variable.

## One-liner Version using Arrow Functions

```js
const greetArrow = (greeting) => (name) => console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);

greetArrow("Hi")("Jonas"); // Output: Hi Jonas
```

- A more compact way using **arrow functions**.
- Might be more difficult to read, especially for beginners.

## Why Use Functions That Return Functions?

While this example may seem simple, this pattern is **very useful** in real-world scenarios:

- When using **functional programming** techniques
- For **function customization** (e.g., creating partially applied functions)
- In **event handling**, **middleware**, **currying**, etc.

### Challenge

Try rewriting the original `greet` function using only arrow functions:

```js
const greet = (greeting) => (name) => console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
```
