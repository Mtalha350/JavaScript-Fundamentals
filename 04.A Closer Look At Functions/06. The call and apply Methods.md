# Understanding `this` in JavaScript: Methods to Manually Set `this`

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object that the function is currently operating on. However, there are situations where we might want to manually set the value of `this`. This can be done using three methods: `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`. This guide explains how to use them.

## The `this` Keyword

The value of `this` depends on how a function is called:

- **Method call**: If a function is called as a method of an object, `this` points to that object.
- **Regular function call**: If a function is called as a regular function (not as a method), `this` is `undefined` (in strict mode).
- **Event handler**: If a function is called in response to an event, `this` points to the element that fired the event.

### Example of `this` in an Object Method

```js
const airline = {
  airlineName: "Lufthansa",
  bookings: [],
  book: function (flightNumber, passengerName) {
    console.log(
      `${passengerName} booked a seat on ${this.airlineName} flight ${flightNumber}`
    );
    this.bookings.push({
      flight: `${this.airlineName} ${flightNumber}`,
      passenger: passengerName,
    });
  },
};

airline.book(239, "Jonas");
console.log(airline.bookings);
```

In this example, `this` points to the `airline` object inside the `book()` method.

## Manually Setting `this`

### 1. `call()`

The `call()` method allows you to call a function with a specific `this` value and pass arguments individually.

```js
function book(flightNumber, passengerName) {
  console.log(
    `${passengerName} booked a seat on ${this.airlineName} flight ${flightNumber}`
  );
}

const eurowings = { airlineName: "Eurowings" };

// Manually setting `this` to `eurowings`
book.call(eurowings, 423, "Sarah Williams");
```

In the example above, `this` is manually set to `eurowings`, and we can use the `book()` function to book a flight on that airline.

### 2. `apply()`

The `apply()` method works similarly to `call()`, but instead of passing arguments individually, you pass them as an array.

```js
const flightData = [423, "Sarah Williams"];

// Using apply to pass arguments as an array
book.apply(eurowings, flightData);
```

### 3. `bind()`

The `bind()` method is slightly different from `call()` and `apply()`. It does not immediately call the function. Instead, it returns a new function with `this` bound to the specified object.

```js
const boundBook = book.bind(eurowings);
boundBook(423, "Sarah Williams"); // Now `this` is always `eurowings`
```

The `bind()` method is useful when you need to create a function where `this` is always bound to a specific value.

## Conclusion

- **`call()`** and **`apply()`** allow you to manually set the `this` keyword and call a function with specific arguments.
- **`bind()`** creates a new function with `this` bound to a specified object, which can be useful for event handlers or delayed execution.
- The spread operator (`...`) is commonly used with `call()` to spread array values as individual arguments.

By understanding how to control the value of `this`, you can write more flexible and reusable functions that can be applied to different objects.
