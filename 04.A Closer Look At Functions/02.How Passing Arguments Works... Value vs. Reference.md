# Passing Arguments into Functions in JavaScript

In this lecture, we‚Äôll explore how arguments are passed into functions in JavaScript, particularly focusing on the differences between **primitive types** and **reference types (objects)**.

---

## üß† Quick Recap: Primitives vs Objects

- **Primitive types** (e.g., strings, numbers) are passed **by value**.
- **Objects** are passed by **reference**, but **not by reference** in the traditional sense of languages like C++. More on that later.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Example: Flight Check-In

```js
const flight = "LH234";
const jonas = {
  name: "Jonas Schmedtmann",
  passport: 123456789,
};

const checkIn = function (flightNum, passenger) {
  flightNum = "LH999";
  passenger.name = "Mr. " + passenger.name;

  if (passenger.passport === 123456789) {
    alert("Checked in");
  } else {
    alert("Wrong passport");
  }
};

checkIn(flight, jonas);
console.log(flight); // LH234
console.log(jonas); // name changed to Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann
```

## üîç What Happened?

### With the `flight` variable:

- A **string** (primitive), so a **copy** of the value is passed.
- Inside the function, modifying `flightNum` doesn‚Äôt affect the original `flight`.

### With the `jonas` object:

- An **object** (reference type), so a **reference to the object** is passed.
- The function modifies the object through that reference, so changes are reflected **outside** the function.

## üìå Key Concept

```js
// Primitives
let a = "hello";
let b = a;
b = "hi";
console.log(a); // 'hello'

// Objects
const obj1 = { name: "Talha" };
const obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Mr. Talha";
console.log(obj1.name); // 'Mr. Talha'
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Pitfall

Modifying objects inside functions can lead to bugs:

```js
const newPassport = function (person) {
  person.passport = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 1000000000);
};

newPassport(jonas);
checkIn(flight, jonas); // Now alerts 'Wrong passport'
```

- We changed `jonas.passport` before checking in.
- Since both functions work on the same object, we introduced a **bug**.

---

## üìö Terminology Clarification

- **Pass by value:** JavaScript always passes arguments **by value**.
- When you pass an object, the **value being passed is the reference (memory address)**.
- This can look like **pass by reference**, but it's technically not.

‚ùå Not pass-by-reference like in C++
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Primitives** ‚Üí Copied ‚Üí Original not affected.
- **Objects** ‚Üí Reference copied ‚Üí Changes affect original.
- JS always uses **pass-by-value** (even for object references).
- Be cautious when multiple functions modify the same object.
