# First-Class Functions in JavaScript

Let's now talk about a fundamental property of the JavaScript language — the fact that it has **first-class functions**.

This enables us to write **higher-order functions**.  
But what's that all about?  
Well, let's see.

## What Are First-Class Functions?

JavaScript is a language that has first-class functions, which in technical terms means that functions are so-called _first-class citizens_.

In practice, that means that **functions are simply treated as values**.  
We already touched on that idea a couple of times before, but this is such an important feature of the language that it's worth spending more time on it.

### Why Does JavaScript Work This Way?

It's because **functions are just another type of object** in JavaScript.  
Since objects are values, **functions are values too**.

And because functions are values, we can do many interesting things with them, such as:

- Storing them in variables
- Adding them as object properties

We’ve already done this a few times before.

For example:

```js
const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

const user = {
  sayHi: function () {
    console.log("Hi!");
  },
};
```

In the above, the **function values** can be stored wherever we like.

## Passing Functions as Arguments

We can also **pass functions as arguments** to other functions.  
We've already done this when adding event listeners.

Example:

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", greet);
```

Here, the `addEventListener` function is receiving another function (`greet`) as an input.

This kind of function that gets passed in is called a **callback function**.  
It's called later by the higher-order function — in this case, when the click event happens.

It’s like the `greet` function saying:

> "Hey there, don’t greet me yet — call me back once you’re ready!"

This technique is used in many other scenarios too, not just with event listeners.

## Returning Functions from Functions

We can also **return a function from another function**.

That may sound a bit crazy at first, but it’s actually very useful and common in JavaScript.

Example:

```js
function createGreeter(greeting) {
  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${name}!`);
  };
}

const greetHello = createGreeter("Hello");
greetHello("Talha"); // Output: Hello, Talha!
```

## Remember: Functions Are Objects

Since functions are objects, they can have their own methods too — like arrays do.

For example, the `.bind()` method:

```js
const greet = function () {
  console.log(this.name);
};

const person = { name: "Talha" };
const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);
greetPerson(); // Talha
```

We’ll explore more of these function methods throughout this section.

## Higher-Order Functions

Thanks to first-class functions, we can write **higher-order functions**.

### What is a Higher-Order Function?

A higher-order function is either:

- A function that **receives another function as an argument**, or
- A function that **returns a new function**.

### 1. Receiving a Function

Example:

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", greet);
```

Here, `addEventListener` is a higher-order function because it receives `greet` as an input.

### 2. Returning a Function

Example:

```js
function multiplier(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

This is another kind of higher-order function that returns a function.

## First-Class vs Higher-Order Functions

Some people think they're the same — but they’re not.

- **First-class functions** is a **feature** of a programming language (a concept).
  - It means: "Functions are values."
- **Higher-order functions** are **actual functions** we use in practice, enabled by the first-class function feature.

So the difference is subtle but important — and useful if you want to sound like a true JavaScript master.

**Great!** You now have a solid understanding of first-class and higher-order functions in JavaScript.
