# Summary of Username Creation Process

In this tutorial, we discussed how to compute usernames for account owners by applying the `map` and `forEach` methods. Below are the key steps and concepts covered.

## Steps to Create Username:

1. **Initial Setup**: We started by manually creating a username for a single user (e.g., "Stephen Thomas Williams") by extracting initials from the user's name.
2. **Transformations**:
   - Convert the name to lowercase.
   - Split the name into words.
   - Use `map` to extract the first letter of each word.
   - Join the initials into a single string (e.g., "stw").

## Code Walkthrough:

1. We created a function that computes a username based on the owner's name.
2. Used the `map` method to generate an array of initials.
3. Then, applied `join` to combine the initials into a final username.

### Example of Username Creation:

```javascript
const user = "Stephen Thomas Williams";

// Step 1: Convert to lowercase
const username = user
  .toLowerCase() // "stephen thomas williams"
  .split(" ") // ["stephen", "thomas", "williams"]
  .map((name) => name[0]) // ["s", "t", "w"]
  .join(""); // "stw"

console.log(username); // Output: "stw"
```

## Handling Multiple Accounts:

1. **Using `forEach`**: Instead of creating a new array, we used `forEach` to loop through each account and modify the existing objects by adding a `username` property.
2. This approach mutates the original accounts array, which is a key distinction from `map`, which creates a new array.

### Example of Using `forEach` to Modify Account Array:

```javascript
const accounts = [
  { owner: "Stephen Thomas Williams", movements: [200, -100, 50] },
  { owner: "John Doe", movements: [150, -50] },
];

// Step 2: Create a username for each account using forEach
accounts.forEach((account) => {
  account.username = account.owner
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(" ")
    .map((name) => name[0])
    .join("");
});

console.log(accounts);
/*
[
  { owner: "Stephen Thomas Williams", movements: [200, -100, 50], username: "stw" },
  { owner: "John Doe", movements: [150, -50], username: "jd" }
]
*/
```

## Conclusion:

- **`map` Method**: Useful for creating new arrays, like the array of initials.
- **`forEach` Method**: Ideal for modifying existing objects in-place (i.e., side effects).
