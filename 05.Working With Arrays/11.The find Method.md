# JavaScript `find()` Method

The `find()` method in JavaScript is used to retrieve a **single element** from an array that satisfies a given condition.

## Key Points:

- **Returns** the first element that satisfies the condition.
- **Stops** as soon as it finds the first match.
- **Does not return an array**â€”it returns a single element.
- Works with a **callback function** that returns a Boolean value (true or false).

### Syntax:

```javascript
array.find(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);
```

- `callback`: A function that is executed on each element of the array.
- `thisArg`: (Optional) Value to use as `this` when executing the callback.

## Example: Finding the First Negative Movement

```javascript
const movements = [200, -150, 400, -120, 600, -50];
const firstWithdrawal = movements.find((movement) => movement < 0);

console.log(firstWithdrawal); // Output: -150 (first negative movement)
```

### Difference from `filter()`:

- **`find()`** returns **only the first matching element**, whereas **`filter()`** returns all matching elements in a new array.
- **`find()`** returns the element itself, while **`filter()`** returns a new array.

## Example with Array of Objects:

```javascript
const accounts = [
  { owner: "Jessica Davis", balance: 5000 },
  { owner: "John Smith", balance: 3000 },
  { owner: "Sarah Lee", balance: 8000 },
];

const account = accounts.find((acc) => acc.owner === "Jessica Davis");

console.log(account); // Output: { owner: 'Jessica Davis', balance: 5000 }
```

### Common Use Case:

- **Finding a specific object** in an array based on a unique property, such as the `owner` of a bank account.
