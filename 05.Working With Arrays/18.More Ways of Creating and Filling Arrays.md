# Summary of Array Programming Techniques in JavaScript

## Creating Arrays Programmatically

- Arrays can be created manually or programmatically in JavaScript.
- Using the `Array()` constructor, an array can be created with a specified length. However, if only one argument is passed, it creates an array of empty elements.

## The `fill()` Method

- The `fill()` method can be used to fill an array with a specified value.
- It can also accept a `start` and `end` parameter to specify the range of indices to fill.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let arr = new Array(7).fill(1);
  console.log(arr); // [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

## Using `Array.from()`

- `Array.from()` creates a new array from array-like structures or iterables.
- It can take a second argument, which is a mapping function, to transform the elements of the array.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let arr = Array.from({ length: 7 }, (_, i) => i + 1);
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
  ```

## Converting Non-Array Objects to Arrays

- JavaScript objects like `NodeList` (returned by `querySelectorAll()`) are array-like but lack array methods.
- `Array.from()` can be used to convert these objects to real arrays, making array methods like `map()` available.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let movements = Array.from(
    document.querySelectorAll(".movements_value"),
    (el) => parseFloat(el.textContent.replace("â‚¬", ""))
  );
  ```

## Alternative to `Array.from()`: The Spread Operator

- The spread operator can also be used to convert array-like structures to arrays.
  ```javascript
  let movementsArray = [...document.querySelectorAll(".movements_value")];
  ```

## Use Cases

- `Array.from()` is useful when working with iterables or array-like objects, such as `NodeList`, `Set`, or `Map`, and allows applying a mapping function for transformation.
- The `fill()` method is useful for initializing or modifying arrays with a single value.

## Final Thoughts

- Understanding array methods is crucial for solving various problems programmatically.
- In the next section, the focus will be on how to choose the appropriate array method for different tasks.
