### `forEach` Method in JavaScript

# JavaScript Array Iteration with `forEach`

## Overview

This lecture explains how to iterate over arrays using the `forEach` method, comparing it to the `for...of` loop, and highlighting key differences and use cases.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### `for...of` Loop:

- Loops over array elements one by one.
- Can use `.entries()` to access index and element:
  ```js
  for (const [i, mov] of movements.entries()) {
    // logic here
  }
  ```

### `forEach` Method:

- A **higher-order function**.
- Takes a **callback function** with up to 3 parameters:

  1. `element` – current array item
  2. `index` – current position
  3. `array` – the full array

  Example:

  ```js
  movements.forEach(function (mov, i, arr) {
    // logic here
  });
  ```

- Cannot use `break` or `continue`.

## 🔁 Use Case: Logging Transactions

```js
movements.forEach(function (mov, i) {
  if (mov > 0) {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You deposited ${mov}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Movement ${i + 1}: You withdrew ${Math.abs(mov)}`);
  }
});
```

## ✅ When to Use

| Feature           | for...of               | forEach             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Break/Continue    | ✅ Supported           | ❌ Not supported    |
| Callback Function | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes              |
| Clean Syntax      | 🤷‍♂️ Personal Preference | ✅ Cleaner for many |

## 🧠 Tip

Understanding how `forEach` passes parameters to the callback is key to mastering many other array methods in JavaScript like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## 🔚 Conclusion

The `forEach` method offers a concise and powerful way to loop over arrays, especially when you don’t need to break early. It’s essential to understand the callback mechanism to work effectively with modern JavaScript.
