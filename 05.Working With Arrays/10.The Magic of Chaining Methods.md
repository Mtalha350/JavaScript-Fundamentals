# Chaining `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` Methods

In JavaScript, the `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` array methods can be chained together to transform data in a clean, readable manner. This allows you to apply multiple transformations to your data without needing intermediate variables.

## Example Scenario

Let's assume we are working with an array of movements that represent deposits and withdrawals in a bank account. We want to calculate the total deposits in US dollars.

### Steps:

1. **Filter** out the deposits (positive movements).
2. **Map** the deposits from Euros to US dollars.
3. **Reduce** the deposits to calculate the total.

### Code:

```javascript
const movements = [200, -150, 400, -120, 600, -50]; // Example data in Euros
const euroToUSD = 1.1; // Conversion rate from Euros to US Dollars

// Step 1: Filter the deposits (positive values)
const depositsInEuros = movements.filter((movement) => movement > 0);

// Step 2: Convert the deposits from Euros to US Dollars
const depositsInUSD = depositsInEuros.map((deposit) => deposit * euroToUSD);

// Step 3: Calculate the total sum of deposits
const totalDepositsUSD = depositsInUSD.reduce(
  (acc, deposit) => acc + deposit,
  0
);

console.log(totalDepositsUSD); // Output: Total deposits in USD
```

### Chaining Example:

You can chain all three methods together to perform the transformations in one step.

```javascript
const totalDepositsUSDChained = movements
  .filter((movement) => movement > 0) // Step 1: Filter deposits
  .map((deposit) => deposit * euroToUSD) // Step 2: Convert to USD
  .reduce((acc, deposit) => acc + deposit, 0); // Step 3: Sum the deposits

console.log(totalDepositsUSDChained); // Output: Total deposits in USD
```

### Output:

Both approaches will give the same output, which is the total sum of all deposits converted to US dollars.

## Debugging Chained Methods

While chaining methods, you might face issues where the result isn't what you expect. In such cases, you can inspect intermediate results at each stage using `console.log()`.

### Example:

```javascript
const totalDepositsUSDWithDebug = movements
  .filter((movement) => {
    console.log("Filtered Movements:", movement);
    return movement > 0;
  })
  .map((deposit) => {
    console.log("Mapped Deposits in USD:", deposit * euroToUSD);
    return deposit * euroToUSD;
  })
  .reduce((acc, deposit) => {
    console.log("Accumulator:", acc, "Current Deposit:", deposit);
    return acc + deposit;
  }, 0);

console.log(totalDepositsUSDWithDebug);
```

This will log each intermediate step, allowing you to better understand the flow of the data.

## Important Notes on Chaining:

- **Performance**: Avoid chaining too many methods on large arrays, as this can lead to performance issues. Try to combine steps where possible.
- **Mutating Methods**: Be cautious when chaining methods that mutate the original array (e.g., `splice()`). It's generally a better practice to use non-mutating methods.
