# JavaScript Array Grouping (ES 2024)

In ES 2024, a new feature called **Array Grouping** was added to JavaScript, enabling developers to group array values based on a condition. This feature simplifies grouping elements, which was previously done using loops or manual categorization.

## How it Works:

- **Syntax**: The array grouping is done through `Object.groupBy()`.

  ```javascript
  const grouped = Object.groupBy(array, callback);
  ```

- The first argument is the array you want to group, and the second is a callback function that defines the grouping logic.
- The callback should return a string that determines the group to which an element belongs.

## Example 1: Grouping by Deposit or Withdrawal

```javascript
const movements = [200, -400, 450, -100];

const groupedMovements = Object.groupBy(movements, (movement) => {
  return movement > 0 ? "Deposits" : "Withdrawals";
});

console.log(groupedMovements);
```

- The movements are grouped into `Deposits` and `Withdrawals` based on whether the value is positive or negative.

## Example 2: Grouping by Activity Level

You can also group objects based on a specific property. For example, categorizing accounts based on the number of movements:

```javascript
const accounts = [
  { movements: [200, -100, 300] },
  { movements: [100, -50] },
  { movements: [] },
];

const groupedAccounts = Object.groupBy(accounts, (account) => {
  const movementCount = account.movements.length;
  if (movementCount >= 8) return "Very Active";
  if (movementCount >= 4) return "Active";
  if (movementCount === 1) return "Moderate";
  return "Inactive";
});

console.log(groupedAccounts);
```

## Example 3: Grouping by Object Property (Account Type)

You can also group objects by a property, such as `type`:

```javascript
const accounts = [
  { type: "premium", movements: [200, 300] },
  { type: "standard", movements: [100] },
  { type: "basic", movements: [50] },
];

const groupedByType = Object.groupBy(accounts, (account) => account.type);

console.log(groupedByType);
```

## Conclusion

Array Grouping is a powerful feature that can be used in various scenarios to group array elements by any given condition. Whether you're grouping by numbers, object properties, or more complex conditions, this feature can streamline many common tasks in JavaScript development.
