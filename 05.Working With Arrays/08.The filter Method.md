# Filter Method Summary

The `filter` method is used to create a new array containing elements that satisfy a certain condition. The condition is specified using a callback function that returns a Boolean value. If the condition is `true`, the element is included in the new array.

## Key Concepts:

- The callback function gets access to the current element, its index, and the entire array.
- The condition should return a Boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- The `filter` method returns a new array with the elements that satisfy the condition.

## Example of Filtering Deposits:

We start with an array of movements and want to filter out the negative values, keeping only the positive ones (deposits).

```javascript
const movements = [200, -100, 50, -300, 120];
const deposits = movements.filter((movement) => movement > 0);
console.log(deposits); // Output: [200, 50, 120]
```

## Example of Filtering Withdrawals:

Similarly, we can create an array of withdrawals (negative values).

```javascript
const withdrawals = movements.filter((movement) => movement < 0);
console.log(withdrawals); // Output: [-100, -300]
```

## Comparison with `for` Loop:

Using `filter` is a more functional approach compared to using a `for` loop. While both methods yield the same result, the `filter` method is more concise and can be chained with other array methods, which is not possible with a traditional `for` loop.

## Practical Benefits:

- Code is more readable and concise.
- Can chain multiple array methods together to build a final result.
- Avoids mutations and side effects like `push` in a `for` loop.

## Conclusion:

The `filter` method is a powerful tool for filtering array elements based on a condition. It's a key part of functional programming in JavaScript.
