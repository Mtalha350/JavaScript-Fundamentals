# JavaScript Array Methods: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

In modern JavaScript, three essential array methods are frequently used for data transformation:

## 1. `map()`

- **Purpose**: Creates a **new array** by applying a function to each element of the original array.
- **Analogy**: Transforms values from one form to another.
- **Example**: Multiply each element by 2.
- **Key Feature**: Returns a new array (unlike `forEach`).

## 2. `filter()`

- **Purpose**: Creates a **new array** with elements that pass a given condition.
- **Analogy**: Like using a sieve—only values that "pass through" the condition are kept.
- **Example**: Filter values greater than 2.
- **Key Feature**: Returns a new array of filtered elements.

## 3. `reduce()`

- **Purpose**: Reduces the array to a **single value** by applying an accumulator function.
- **Analogy**: Snowball effect—accumulator grows as it rolls through the array.
- **Example**: Add up all elements to get their sum.
- **Key Feature**: Returns a single value, not an array.

These methods provide powerful ways to manipulate and transform data efficiently and are widely used in modern JavaScript development.
