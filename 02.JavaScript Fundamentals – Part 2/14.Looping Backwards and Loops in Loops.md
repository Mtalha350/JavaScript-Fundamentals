# Lecture on Looping in JavaScript

In this lecture, we're gonna do two interesting things.

## 1. Looping Over an Array Backwards

First, we will loop over an array backwards, and then second, we will also create a loop inside another loop. So, let's have some more fun with arrays now.

We are working with the `Jonas` array. Forget about the element here. Now, as I said at the beginning of this video, let's loop over this array backwards.

### Looping Over Array from Last to First

The first element that we want to print is this one, then this, this, this, and finally, Jonas.

In the last lecture, we looped from the beginning. So, we started with index `0`, then `1`, all the way to `4`. But now, we want to start at `4`, then we want to go to `3`, and all the way to `0`, which will be the last index.

So, now we need to create the loop according to this new information.

The loop should start with the counter, `i`, and the initial value of the counter should be `4`. But we shouldn't hard-code the value `4`, right?

Why? Because hard-coded values like this are not a good idea. So what is `4`? Well, `4` is basically just the length of the array minus one. So, we write `Jonas.length - 1` instead of hard-coding `4`.

### Loop Condition

The loop should stop after reaching index `0`. So the condition we need to write should be `i >= 0` (as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`).

We use `i--` instead of `i++` to decrease the index.

### Code Example:

```javascript
for (let i = Jonas.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  console.log(Jonas[i]);
}
```

This will print the array starting from the last element.

### Simulating the Loop

- At `i = 4`, the condition `i >= 0` is `true`, so the loop runs.
- The counter gets updated to `3`, and this repeats until the counter becomes `-1`, and the loop stops.

### Checking the Output

This loop should work as expected. Let's also check the counter and the current array value at each iteration.

### Result:

```javascript
i: 4, Jonas[i]: Jonas
i: 3, Jonas[i]: Peter
i: 2, Jonas[i]: Michael
i: 1, Jonas[i]: Sarah
i: 0, Jonas[i]: Tom
```

So now we know how to loop backwards through an array.

## 2. Looping Inside a Loop

Now, let's create a loop inside another loop. This sounds complex, but it's not too difficult.

### Gym Example

Let's go back to our gym example. We had 10 repetitions for a certain weightlifting exercise. Now, let's say that we have three different exercises, and we want to repeat each exercise five times. This gives us a total of 15 repetitions (5 for each of the three exercises).

### Nested Loops

To log all these repetitions, we will need a loop inside another loop. Let's start by looping through the exercises.

```javascript
for (let exercise = 1; exercise <= 3; exercise++) {
  console.log(`Exercise ${exercise}:`);
}
```

### Adding Repetitions

Next, we need to create the inner loop for the repetitions. For each exercise, we want to repeat it five times.

```javascript
for (let exercise = 1; exercise <= 3; exercise++) {
  console.log(`Exercise ${exercise}:`);

  for (let rep = 1; rep <= 5; rep++) {
    console.log(`  Repetition ${rep}`);
  }
}
```

### Testing the Output

What do we expect to see?

- We start with Exercise 1, and inside this loop, we run the repetition loop five times.
- After finishing Exercise 1, the outer loop continues to Exercise 2, and again, the repetition loop runs five times.
- Finally, Exercise 3 runs its repetitions.

### Result:

```javascript
Exercise 1:
  Repetition 1
  Repetition 2
  Repetition 3
  Repetition 4
  Repetition 5
Exercise 2:
  Repetition 1
  Repetition 2
  Repetition 3
  Repetition 4
  Repetition 5
Exercise 3:
  Repetition 1
  Repetition 2
  Repetition 3
  Repetition 4
  Repetition 5
```

### Conclusion

We have successfully created a loop inside another loop. This is useful in many scenarios, such as when you have multiple categories and each category has its own set of iterations.

## 3. Final Thoughts

Even though you might not use this kind of looping often in real-world code, it's a great exercise to help you understand how loops can be used flexibly.
