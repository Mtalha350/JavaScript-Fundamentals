# JavaScript Functions: A Quick Summary

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Function?

A **function** is a reusable block of code in JavaScript.  
It's similar to a variable, but instead of holding a value, it holds one or more lines of executable code.

```js
function logger() {
  console.log("My name is Jonas");
}
```
