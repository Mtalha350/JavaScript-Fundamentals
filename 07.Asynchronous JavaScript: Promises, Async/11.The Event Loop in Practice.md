# JavaScript Asynchronous Runtime Demonstration

## Overview

This demonstration showcases how JavaScript's asynchronous runtime behaves using:

* Synchronous logs
* `setTimeout` with 0ms delay
* Resolved promises (microtasks)
* A simulated long-running microtask

It reinforces the concept that **microtasks have priority over macrotasks** in the event loop.

---

## Code Summary

```js
console.log('Test Start');

setTimeout(() => console.log('0 sec timer'), 0);

Promise.resolve('Resolved Promise 1').then(res => console.log(res));

console.log('Test End');
```

### Output Order Explanation:

1. **"Test Start"** – synchronous log
2. **"Test End"** – synchronous log
3. **"Resolved Promise 1"** – microtask
4. **"0 sec timer"** – macrotask (callback queue)

Even though the timer is set to 0ms, it’s executed *after* all microtasks are finished.

---

## Simulating a Long-Running Microtask

```js
Promise.resolve('Resolved Promise 2').then(res => {
  // Simulate long task
  for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++) {}
  console.log(res);
});
```

### Observation:

* The `0 sec timer` message is delayed until the long microtask finishes.
* Confirms that **timers are not guaranteed to execute exactly at the delay time**, especially when microtasks are still running.

---

## Key Takeaways

* JavaScript executes all synchronous code first.
* Resolved Promises go to the **microtask queue**.
* `setTimeout` callbacks go to the **callback queue (macrotask)**.
* **Microtasks always run before any macrotasks**.
* Long microtasks can delay macrotasks (e.g., timers).
* Timer delays (e.g., `setTimeout(..., 0)`) are **not precise** guarantees of execution timing.
