# Web Requests and Responses – High-Level Overview

This document summarizes how requests and responses work on the Web, focusing on the client-server model, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and the TCP/IP protocols.

---

## 🔁 Request-Response Model

- The **Web** works on a **request-response model**, also known as **client-server architecture**.
- The **browser (client)** sends a request to the **web server**, which returns a **response**.
- This applies to **entire web pages** and **API data** alike.

---

## 🌐 URL Breakdown

- **Protocol**: `http://` or `https://`
- **Domain name**: e.g. `restcountries.eu`
- **Resource path**: e.g. `/rest/v2/alpha`

---

## 📡 DNS Resolution

- **Domain names** are human-friendly, but not real server addresses.
- The browser queries a **DNS (Domain Name Server)** to convert the domain into an **IP address**.
- DNS acts like the Internet's **phone book**.

---

## 🔌 TCP/IP & Connection Establishment

- After DNS resolution, a **TCP socket connection** is established using:
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: breaks data into packets.
  - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: routes packets via IP addresses.
- Connection is kept **alive** while files/data are being transferred.

---

## 📨 HTTP Request

- Protocol: **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** or **HTTPS** (secure via TLS/SSL).
- Components of an HTTP request:
  1. **Start Line**: HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) + target + HTTP version.
  2. **Headers**: metadata (e.g. browser info, language).
  3. **Body** (optional): sent with methods like `POST`, contains data.

---

## 📬 HTTP Response

- Sent by the server after handling the request.
- Components:
  1. **Start Line**: HTTP version + **status code** (e.g. `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
  2. **Headers**: response metadata.
  3. **Body**: data sent back (e.g. JSON, HTML, etc.).

---

## 📁 Multiple Requests for Web Pages

- A single web page request results in many additional requests:
  - HTML is parsed to find assets like **JS**, **CSS**, and **images**.
  - Each asset is fetched via its own HTTP request.
  - Multiple concurrent requests are possible but limited.

---

## 📦 TCP/IP Packet Handling

- **TCP** splits data into **packets**, reassembles them at the destination.
- **IP** is responsible for **routing** packets through the Internet.
- This improves performance by allowing packets to take different paths.

---

## 🔐 HTTP vs HTTPS

- **HTTPS** = secure version of HTTP.
- Uses **TLS/SSL** encryption for secure data transfer.
- Request/response structure remains the same.

---

## ✅ Summary

- The Web is built on protocols like **HTTP**, **TCP/IP**, and systems like **DNS**.
- Understanding how data moves helps debug and optimize web interactions.
- Developers don’t write raw HTTP requests but should understand their structure.
