# 📘 Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX & APIs — Summary

## 🧠 Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript

### 🔁 Synchronous Code

* Executes **line by line**, in the **defined order**.
* Each line **waits** for the previous one to complete.
* Example: `alert()` blocks the next lines from running until user clicks OK.

### 🔄 Asynchronous Code

* Allows **non-blocking** execution.
* Code **does not wait** for time-consuming tasks (e.g. timers, image loading).
* **Callback functions** are registered and executed **later**, after the async task completes.

### ✅ Key Concepts

* `setTimeout()` is an **asynchronous function** — registers a timer and runs a callback after the delay, without blocking main thread.
* Asynchronous != just using callback functions. E.g., `Array.map()` is synchronous even though it uses callbacks.
* Asynchronous behavior comes from the function doing **background work** (e.g., timers, image loading, network requests).

## 🖼️ Image Loading Example

* Setting `img.src = "image.jpg"` is **asynchronous**.
* Uses `addEventListener("load", callback)` to run code once the image finishes loading.
* Listener **does not make** code asynchronous — the **task itself** (loading) is async.

## 🌐 AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

### 🔍 What is AJAX?

* Enables **asynchronous communication** with a **web server**.
* Fetches data **without reloading** the page.
* Common request types: `GET` (fetch data), `POST` (send data).

### 📦 Common Use Cases

* Request country info, weather, maps, currency exchange rates, etc.
* Used in building **dynamic**, **data-driven** web applications.

## 🔗 APIs: Application Programming Interfaces

### ⚙️ What is an API?

* **Interface** that allows software to **communicate** with other software.
* Can be:

  * DOM API (manipulate HTML)
  * Geolocation API
  * Custom APIs built in classes

### 🌍 Online/Web APIs

* Hosted on **web servers**.
* Receive requests, fetch data (from DB), and send responses.
* Examples: OpenWeatherMap, REST Countries, Google Maps, etc.

### 👨‍💻 Types of APIs

* **Own API**: Built and hosted by you.
* **3rd-party APIs**: Created by others, used in your app (often free).

## 📄 Data Formats in APIs

### 📘 XML (Old)

* Used historically.
* AJAX = “Asynchronous JavaScript and XML”

### 📙 JSON (Current)

* Now the **most used** data format.
* Simple: just a **JavaScript object** in **string** form.
* Easily parsed with `JSON.parse()` and created with `JSON.stringify()`.

---

## 🚀 Summary

* Asynchronous JavaScript allows for **non-blocking, time-based**, or **event-driven** code execution.
* AJAX is a key use case for async JS, enabling data fetching from web servers.
* APIs allow apps to talk to other systems — essential for dynamic web development.
* JSON has replaced XML as the **standard** for data exchange in modern APIs.
