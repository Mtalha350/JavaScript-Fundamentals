# Summary: Handling Fetch Errors in JavaScript

This lecture focuses on managing errors in JavaScript when working with the Fetch API, specifically dealing with failed HTTP responses like 404 errors. Here's a summary of the key takeaways and practices discussed:

## Problem Overview

* The `fetch` function does not reject promises on HTTP errors (like 404 or 400); it only rejects on network failures.
* This can lead to misleading or undefined behavior if not handled properly.

## Manual Error Handling

* Use the `response.ok` property to manually check for HTTP errors.
* If `response.ok` is `false`, throw a custom `Error` to reject the promise manually:

```js
if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Country not found (${response.status})`);
```

## Promise Propagation

* Throwing an error in a `.then()` handler causes the returned promise to reject.
* This rejection is caught in the `.catch()` block where it can be handled gracefully.

## Creating a Helper Function

To reduce repetitive code, a helper function `getJSON` is created:

```js
const getJSON = function(url, errorMsg = 'Something went wrong') {
  return fetch(url).then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`${errorMsg} (${response.status})`);
    return response.json();
  });
};
```

### Usage Example

Replace typical fetch logic with `getJSON`:

```js
getJSON(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/portugal`, 'Country not found')
  .then(data => renderCountry(data))
  .catch(err => displayError(err.message));
```

## Handling No Neighbor Case

* When a country has no neighbor (e.g., Australia), ensure to throw an error:

```js
if (!neighbor) throw new Error('No neighbor found');
```

## Why Handle Errors?

* Enhances user experience by displaying meaningful error messages.
* Prevents uncaught promise rejections.
* Critical for building robust real-world applications.

## Conclusion

To handle errors properly in async JavaScript:

* Always check `response.ok` and throw custom errors.
* Use `.catch()` to handle all errors in the promise chain.
* Abstract repeated logic into helper functions.
* Gracefully handle edge cases like missing data.
